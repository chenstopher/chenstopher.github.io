		<p><a href="../images/2008/11/canvas_bag.jpg"><img alt="" src="../images/2008/11/canvas_bag-150x150.jpg" title="canvas_bag" /></a>So
here's my old messenger bag. I found it on dell.com and thought it was
the coolest messenger bag in the world. It was cheap, had some awesome
tattoo-like thing on it, and some super innovative closing mechanism. So
I ordered it and it came. Shit, I was wrong. It was a bigger than I had
expected. The tattoo-like thing looked kinda ghey. And the innovative
closing mechanism took for-freaking-ever to close! If I packed it with
my laptop and other things, it got really heavy and my shoulder would
hurt cause there is no padding on the strap. But whatever, I didn't feel
like getting another one so I dealt with that crap for a couple months.</p>
<p>Then I found <a href="http://www.chromebags.com">Chrome</a> bags. Man, they are so
awesome. They look pretty awesome and they have this super cool seatbelt
strap thing. I did some research and found out they are pretty much
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwNlBfLix4">indestructible.</a> One thing
I was worried about was size cause all the pics on the site made the bag
look HUGE. But whatever, I ordered it anyway. I got the smallest size,
cause I didn't want it to be too big.</p>
<p>After about a week it came. And here it is. Looks pretty awesome. Got
the Red/black stripe one cause red is awesome and so is black. Check out
that SUPER COOL seatbelt buckle! The strap is also really comfortable
and easily adjustable.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/11/chrome_1.jpg"><img alt="" src="../images/2008/11/chrome_1-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_1" /></a><a href="../images/2008/11/chrome_2_strap.jpg"><img alt="" src="../images/2008/11/chrome_2_strap-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_2_strap" /></a><a href="../images/2008/11/chrome_3_buckle.jpg"><img alt="" src="../images/2008/11/chrome_3_buckle-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_3_buckle" /></a></p>
<p>One problem though. ITS TOO FREAKING SMALL! I put my laptop, laptop
charger, a couple magazines and a chemistry workbook from sophomore year
of high school that I found in the bag and it barely fit. The bag looks
like its gonna explode.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/11/chrome_4_inside.jpg"><img alt="" src="../images/2008/11/chrome_4_inside-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_4_inside" /></a><a href="../images/2008/11/chrome_5_explode.jpg"><img alt="" src="../images/2008/11/chrome_5_explode-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_5_explode" /></a><a href="../images/2008/11/chrome_6_explode.jpg"><img alt="" src="../images/2008/11/chrome_6_explode-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_6_explode" /></a></p>
<p>I emailed Chrome. I'm gonna exchange it for the next size up. Hopefully
it will be the right size. Shipping is expensive!</p>
<p>I hate it when I get hyped up for something I ordered online and when it
finally gets here it turns out not how I expected. Sigh.</p>

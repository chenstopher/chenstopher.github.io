<p>I ordered a pair of shoes last week that was slated to arrive Monday.
They never showed up. So I checked the UPS tracking info to see what the
heck happened. It just said, "The package was missed at the UPS
facility, UPS will deliver on the next business day". Thinking that
they'd just deliver the thing tomorrow (like it said in the message), I
just put it off as some UPS nonsense and decided to wait for it to
arrive on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tuesday comes, doesn't show up. Wednesday, doesn't show up. Each day the
UPS tracking info page updates at 10:00 pm saying the same exact
message: "The package was missed at the UPS facility, UPS will deliver
on the next business day."Â Surely, something must have gone wrong. I
give Zappos a call and they say to just wait it out and if it doesn't
arrive, just give them another call.</p>
<p>So I wait another day and guess what.. the shoes still haven't arrived.
I call up Zappos again, explain my situation, and the guy says they'll
just send another pair free of charge (btw, great customer support). The
very second I get off the phone, some guy comes to the door and rings
the bell. It's the UPS guy. With my shoes. That I ordered last week.</p>
<p>I end up calling Zappos for the third time to explain my matter of great
coincidental timing and tell them to cancel that order they made just
two minutes prior.</p>
<p>So that's my exciting ordering shoes online story.</p>

		<p>Some guy I used to be good friends with instant-messaged me today. It
was totally unexpected and weird and cool. Sent me down this spiral of
looking up people from my past (which was difficult cause I don't
use/have facebook). It was strange seeing people I haven't even thought
about in years again. It was depressing.</p>
<p>I had this theory when I was kid that when you flew on an airplane to
some destination on the other side of the planet, that the airplane
wasn't actually moving, but the world outside was being reconstructed
into the destination. Further places took longer because the landscapes,
cultures, people were more different than places closer to where you
were currently. What a stupid fucking self-centered idea.</p>
<p>Note to past Chris: you are/were stupid. Note to future Chris: do
something.</p>

		<p>I went snowboarding at <a href="http://windhammountain.com" title="Windham Mountain">Windham
Mountain</a> for a couple of
days during Christmas. There wasn't much snowfall this year so not many
of the trails were open but it was better that I expected. They have
this waffle house thing near the base of the hill so every time you get
on the lift you smelled awesomeness. I thought that was pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Finally learned how to ride switch. The trick is toe-side turns =
squeeze your knees together, heel-side turns = push your knees apart.</p>

<p>I brought my Drift camera with me and a got a bunch of videos. The one
above is from one of the night sessions runs. It's my favorite video
cause Georo falls a lot in it. And by a lot I mean every time he tries
to do a jump.</p>

		<p>I just spent three hours trying to fall asleep. I even tried listening
to NPR to bore myself to sleep but that didn't work. So now I'm just
gonna stay awake till my 8 o' clock morning class.</p>
<p>Ironically, I watched
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278504/" title="Insomnia (2002)">Insomnia</a> prior
to going to bed. Good movie, but maybe I shouldn't have watched it.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I hate that false motivation I get during the first few weeks of school.
The "This semester I will actually read the textbook, pay attention in
lecture, and take notes" thought always goes through my head when I'm
heading back to school. Yeah sure, I'll stick with it for the first
couple of weeks. But as it gets deeper and deeper into the semester, all
that "I'm actually gonna do something" motivation suddenly disappears
and I just end up wasting my free time on the internets.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I was wondering how much it would cost if I missed a day of class.</p>
<p>If you don't count the fees, housing, and meal plan:<br />
costPerClass = \$2,485 tuition / (5 courses * 15 weeks * 2 classes
per week per course)<br />
costPerClass == \$16.57</p>
<p>If you do count the fees, housing, and meal plan:<br />
costPerClass = \$8,250 tuition / (5 courses * 15 weeks * 2 classes
per week per course)<br />
costPerClass == \$55</p>
<p>Hmm, it was actually less than I thought it would be.</p>

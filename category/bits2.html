		<p>26 November 2010</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I told myself I wasn’t going to buy anything but Steam games this Black
Friday but I couldn’t resist. <a href="http://www.thehumansolution.com/kinesis-advantage.html">The Human
Solution</a> was
having a sale on the <a href="http://kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm">Kinesis
Advantage</a> (a \$300 dollar
keyboard) with a 10% off coupon for Black Friday and free shipping. FREE
SHIPPING!</p>
<p><a href="../images/2010/11/kinesis_advantage.jpg"><img alt="kinesis_advantage" src="../images/2010/11/kinesis_advantage_thumb.jpg" title="kinesis_advantage" /></a></p>
<p>Yep, I just bought this keyboard for \$242.10, shipped.</p>
<p>Now let me explain. My RSI/carpal-tunnel symptoms have been getting
worse and worse so I’ve been looking for some ergonomic keyboards to
help fix it. There is quite a selection of them but I wanted one with
mechanical switches leaving only a few (expensive) choices. Among them
was the the Kinesis Advantage, one of the highest-regarded ergonomic
keyboards. The huge price tag had put me off initially but then I
thought about it for a bit. Here’s the rationale I came up with to
convince myself into buying it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m probably going to be making a living typing on a keyboard, might
    as well make it a nice one and not ruin my hands.</li>
<li>I’m hoping this will help with the RSI/carpal-tunnel problems.
    Better get a ergonomic keyboard than have to go to doctor to treat
    them, right?</li>
<li>It’ll make me type faster and be more productive (hopefully).</li>
<li>It’ll look super cool!</li>
<li>\$242.10 is still not that expensive for a keyboard is it? I feel
    like keyboards are often the most neglected piece of computer
    hardware and most people buy the cheapest one they can find. As a
    person who uses the computer for the majority of the day, the
    keyboard is one of the most important pieces of a system. It’s how
    you interact with your computer, how you control it (yeah, yeah,
    there’s the mouse too). It should be on par with the other
    components of your system.</li>
<li>IT’S 19.3% OFF!</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one was what really convinced me to buy it. Can’t mess with
the percentages man.</p>
<p>I will probably put up a review when I get it. I’m excited; I love
getting stuff in the mail.</p>

you can get double the amount of referral storage. Instead of 250mb per

existing ones too.</p>
<p>Just visit <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/edu">dropbox.com/edu</a> and have them

<p>I implemented the A* pathfinding algorithm in python/pygame today. Yep.
I was bored of doing Source SDK stuff for my CSE381 class and so I
decided to learn a new language, framework, and algorithm. The program
itself is pretty basic and isn't really that optimized but it
works. Maybe I'll post the executable once I figure out how to build
python code into exes.</p>
<p>I'm actually really liking python/pygame. Maybe I'll make my next game
with it.</p>

		<h1><a href="../update-on-dvorak.html">Update on Dvorak</a></h1>
		<p>14 September 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I am sad to say that I haven't really reached my goal of 100 wpm yet.
Right now, the fastest I can type with Dvorak is around 70-80 wpm. It's
close but not quite there. The one thing that I've found increasing
annoying with my use of Dvorak is the extra focus on the right pinky.
Both the L and S keys are pressed with the right pinky. When I'm typing
for long periods on time, it really stresses out my right pinky and
causes some pain. In fact, I feel like I use my right fingers way more
than the left ones and often have to take breaks from typing cause my
right arm hurts. The only time I need to move my left fingers up and
down rows is to type punctuation or some other less common letters. But
its the opposite for my right hand. I feel like its all over the place
and the balance is all lopsided.</p>
<p>Just recently I came across another keyboard layout called Colemak. I've
actually known about it since I discovered Dvorak but didn't really look
into it but I was trying not to fall asleep today in my EUR201 class and
decided to do some research on Colemak. The change in Colemak isn't
nearly as drastic as Dvorak. Many of the keys are in the same place as
QWERTY and I think only around 17 key positions moved. Plus, the Ctrl
ZXCV shortcut keys are all in the same place unlike Dvorak, where I have
to use to take my hand off the mouse to use them. There also isn't the L
and S pinky problem like in Dvorak. I'm thinking about trying out
Colemak during the next break from school to see how it is. Hopefully
it'll get rid of the right hand pain but I guess I'll just stick with
Dvorak for now.</p>
<p>Oh and I set my Caps Lock key to Backspace and replaced the Context Menu
key with Caps Lock. Seeing how I don't really use Caps Lock and never
use the Context Menu key, I thought it would be nice to have the
Backspace at a better location on the keyboard.</p>

		<h1><a href="../dvorak.html">DVORAK</a></h1>
		<p>20 January 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Last time I tried to learn dvorak, it was a complete failure. I was
typing way too slow and I had work to complete so I just gave up on it.
I've decided to try and learn it again mainly because I was completely
bored out of my mind but also cause I've been starting to feel some pain
in my fingers. Dvorak is supposed to be "healthier" for your fingers or
something cause you don't have to move your fingers as much.</p>
<p>I already had my desktop keyboard switched to dvorak. I wanted to
seriously learn it this time so I even converted my Macbook's keys to
dvorak. Wasn't too hard. Just popped them off with a tiny screw driver
and put them back in the correct order. Now people who want to use my
computer won't be able to because all the keys are in the wrong places.
Awesome!</p>

<p>I've been playing typeracer everyday since I've switched over to speed
up my typing. Right now I'm typing at around 40 wpm (vs 80wpm when I was
using qwerty) which isn't too bad considering I've only been using
dvorak for four days. But I feel like a noob cause I have to keep
looking at the keys. The most annoying thing about dvorak is that all
the shortcut keys are now on the other side of the keyboard. Ctrl-c,
ctrl-v, ctrl-s, ctrl-z are all on the right side. Also I keep typing
"ass" when I want to type "all" because the 's' is now where the 'l'
used to be. Kind of annoying</p>
<p>That's all for now. Off to play some more typeracer. I'll revisit this
when my typing speed reaches 100+ wpm.</p>

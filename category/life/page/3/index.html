		<p>I couldn’t sleep so I spent the whole night looking through reddit.com.</p>
<p>Some interesting stuff going on.</p>
<p>Okay maybe not.</p>
<p>School is starting up soon. That sucks.</p>
<p>I really don’t want to go back to school.</p>
<p>I think medicine, doctors, technology and all that stuff are limiting
the rate that humans are evolving. That is if evolution works.</p>
<p>Why is my iPhone so slow?</p>
<p>If I go to sleep, I don’t want to wake up. If I stay awake, I don’t want
to sleep.</p>
<p>Sunflower seeds are pretty good.</p>
<p>The street lights on my block turn off at about 6:52 am. This picture
was taken at 6:39.</p>

sunrise" src="../../../../images/2009/01/012209sunrise-thumb.jpg" title="012209 sunrise" /></a></p>
<p>That’s not the sun.</p>
<p>There was this dude on the train the other day. He was arguing with the
other dudes about how his girlfriend wasn’t let on some bus. I think he
was drunk. It was interesting.</p>
<p>I stay up really late sometimes. I like it cause everyone else is
sleeping.</p>
<p>Do not litter.</p>
<p>I usually sleep around 6. But its been taking me a lot longer to fall
asleep lately. I don’t know why.</p>
<p>These sunflower seeds taste funny.</p>
<p>Actually I do know why. But I’m not telling you.</p>
<p>I like it when I stay up really late and I get really tired. So tired
that my eyes wont stay open. I like going to sleep during that time.</p>
<p>Hey look, Chloe is sleeping.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../images/2009/01/chloesleeping.jpg"><img alt="chloe
sleeping" src="../../../../images/2009/01/chloesleeping-thumb.jpg" title="chloe sleeping" /></a></p>
<p>She’s gotten bigger.</p>
<p>I miss my watch.</p>
<p>Oh and about the Windows 7 on my laptop post that I said I was gonna do.
I’m not gonna do it cause I don’t care and you don’t care. Maybe you do
care but I don’t care that you care. So stop caring.</p>
<p>jQuery’s slideDown function is pissing me off. WORK.</p>
<p>“Then why do we die?” –awesome kid</p>
<p>I think I’ll go to sleep now. Maybe.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Well, what is there to say? It’s the new year and it’ll probably be the
same as the last year.</p>
<p>I don’t really have any new year resolutions cause I don’t believe in
them. No one ever sticks to them and I bet you probably couldn’t even
remember the resolutions you set last year.</p>
<p>Now we’re all gonna get messed up when we have to write the date cause
we’re used to writing 2008. Now we have to get used to this new crap,
2009.</p>
<p>The new ball looks pretty cool though. Lots of pretty lights.</p>
<p>I think I’ll change my wordpress theme.</p>
<p>Hey, we’re one year closer to the end of the world.</p>
<p>Australia got their new year 16 hours ago. I think. And its like summer
there. Weird.</p>
<p>LEAP SECOND! Cause the earth isn’t spinning fast enough.</p>
<p>Hey, exactly one year ago the earth was standing the same place it is
now. I think.</p>

		<p>We finally got to go snowboarding even though the trip was nearly
cancelled. It was a four day trip to
<a href="http://www.belleayre.com">Belleayre</a>, a small but fun mountain. The
conditions ranged from wet slushy snow to man-made snow over ice and
super fog to bright sunshine. The ice sucked but it was pretty good
overall. I finally learned to ride switch which is awesome. And this is
how it went down.</p>

		<p>It’s snowing! Although it isn’t the first time this season its still
pretty awesome. Weather.com says its gonna be about 4-6 inches of snow
around campus.</p>
<p>I hope there’s like 100 times more snow up on the mountains. I want to
ride some snow up there not some stupid ice we’re known for on the ICE
COAST. I’m extra excited to go this season. I don’t really know why. I
guess cause college has been a crap load of work and snowboarding is
such a great way to just chill.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>A couple days ago, I went to the
<a href="http://www.campusdining.org/location-union-commons?PHPSESSID=3793723da705a07bf83ca0fad2a01fd3">Union</a>
to get some food with people. I went in and grabbed CJ's Chicken Tenders
and a cream soda and sat down to eat. I start eating the chicken tenders
one by one not really paying attention to what they looked like.
Finally, I got to the last one and noticed something strange about it.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like a PENIS!</strong></p>

<p>I thought It would be funny to put
<a href="http://qtjoel.com/2008/10/14/jason-tutoring/">Jason</a> on it. Just look
at his face! What a douche.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../images/2008/11/chicken-tender-5.jpg"><img alt="Chicken Tender

<p>I still haven't eaten the penis-shaped chicken tender 'cause it seems
kind of awkward. It stuck it in the fridge and now its just sitting
there. Maybe someday someone will open it and eat it, not paying
attention to the shape of it, and we'll all laugh at him. Penis-eater.</p>

		<p>I woke up on Saturday around 3 o' clock in the afternoon and walked
downstairs to get some food. Then suddenly Clifford (my younger brother,
not actually the Big Red Dog) walks in with a box. I go, "WTF is that?"
He says, "It's a puppy!"</p>
<p>So here's Chloe.</p>

<p>And a video:</p>

</p>

<p>I don't know how Cliff got my mom to get the dog. My mom used to always
complain about how they're such a hassle. They shed, shit and piss
everywhere. But I guess its kind of cool having one around.</p>

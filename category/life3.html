<p>I usually sleep around 6. But its been taking me a lot longer to fall

<p>These sunflower seeds taste funny.</p>
<p>Actually I do know why. But I’m not telling you.</p>
<p>I like it when I stay up really late and I get really tired. So tired
that my eyes wont stay open. I like going to sleep during that time.</p>

<p>Oh and about the Windows 7 on my laptop post that I said I was gonna do.
I’m not gonna do it cause I don’t care and you don’t care. Maybe you do

		<p>30 December 2008</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>We finally got to go snowboarding even though the trip was nearly
cancelled. It was a four day trip to
<a href="http://www.belleayre.com">Belleayre</a>, a small but fun mountain. The
conditions ranged from wet slushy snow to man-made snow over ice and
super fog to bright sunshine. The ice sucked but it was pretty good
overall. I finally learned to ride switch which is awesome. And this is
how it went down.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Day One: Clear skies, loose granular.</h2>
<p>We left early Friday morning after staying up the previous night playing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunbound_">Gunbound</a>(we were bored, really
really bored). A lot of people went: my mom, dad, Georo, Hannan,
Quentin, Brian, Clifford, Kevin, Alpha and me. David was supposed to
come but he was a little girl and stayed home. It was gonna be a long
drive so we brought <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386064/">Tae Guk Gi</a>
with us. Ended up not watching it.There was a really nice sunrise on the
way there. Got a couple of pictures of it. It was a pretty boring ride
so the guys fell asleep.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/12/snv33615.jpg"><img alt="SNV33615" src="../images/2008/12/snv33615-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33615" /></a>
<a href="../images/2008/12/snv33623.jpg"><img alt="SNV33623" src="../images/2008/12/snv33623-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33623" /></a>
<a href="../images/2008/12/snv33627.jpg"><img alt="SNV33627" src="../images/2008/12/snv33627-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33627" /></a></p>
<p>We finally got to the mountain. The snow was okay, at least it wasn’t
ice. Hannan has never gone snowboarding so on his first time off the
chairlift, he did a face plant. It was pretty funny. I made a few runs
and then we got stuck on the lift! We must’ve been there for at least 30
minutes.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/imRONr8pcNQ'

                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>Me and Georo did a couple runs at the upper mountain and that was the
end of day one. I was pretty tired ‘cause it’s been a while since I last
went snowboarding.</p>
<h2>Day Two: Rain and Fog, Wet Snow.</h2>
<p>The day started out kinda crappy. We woke up to rain so we decided to
wait till it stopped to go up to the mountain. The snow got all wet but
it wasn’t that bad. But the sky was FREAKING FOGGY.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/12/snv33637.jpg"><img alt="SNV33637" src="../images/2008/12/snv33637-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33637" /></a>

<p>I recorded Georo going down on the last run. He tried to hit a crap load
of jumps but fell on nearly all of them. Turn the volume down, all
you’re gonna hear is wind.</p>

                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<h2>Day Three: Cloudy skies, slush.</h2>
<p>The weather suddenly got a lot warmer on the third day, around the 40’s
and 50’s. It caused a lot of the snow to melt and it formed puddles of
slush and water everywhere making everyone get wet.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/12/snv33645.jpg"><img alt="SNV33645" src="../images/2008/12/snv33645-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33645" /></a>

<p>Some funny stuff happened today too. According to Hannan, Quentin got
anal raped. Hahahaha.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dllPLMOqeS0'
                    frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen
                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>I recorded Georo again but in the middle of it I fall cause I was trying
to ride switch. Yeah, that wasn’t fun.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IoG2-iRIFD8'

                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>Then Georo recorded me, I fell again cause there was an unexpected pile
snow there. Georo doesn’t know how to hold a camera.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/o0-sTulHRgg'
                    frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen
                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>And here’s a video of Hannan heelsliding his way down the mountain.
Haha.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnfhgkYqIaM'
                    frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen
                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<h2>Day Four: Clear Skies, Ice Ice Ice.</h2>
<p>The fourth day was so bad. The temperature got colder and the water and
slush from the previous day froze and turned into ice. To add onto that,
the edges on my board were super dull. I was slipping and sliding
everywhere. Ice SUCKS. At least the temperature was cold enough for them
to make snow but it still wasn’t enough to cover the ICEEEEEE.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/12/pano1.jpg"><img alt="pano" src="../images/2008/12/pano-thumb1.jpg" title="pano" /></a></p>
<p>Quentin got hurt again. This time he hurt his neck and had to be brought
down by one of those sled things. I didn’t get to see it, wished I got
it on video.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a pretty fun trip. The conditions weren’t as nice as I
wanted them to be but its okay cause I finally learned to ride switch.
Hopefully, we’ll get to go to somewhere more awesome next time like
Vermont or maybe even Colorado or Utah.</p>
<p>I need new boots.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>It’s snowing! Although it isn’t the first time this season its still
pretty awesome. Weather.com says its gonna be about 4-6 inches of snow
around campus.</p>
<p>I hope there’s like 100 times more snow up on the mountains. I want to
ride some snow up there not some stupid ice we’re known for on the ICE
COAST. I’m extra excited to go this season. I don’t really know why. I
guess cause college has been a crap load of work and snowboarding is
such a great way to just chill.</p>

		<p>09 November 2008</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>A couple days ago, I went to the
<a href="http://www.campusdining.org/location-union-commons?PHPSESSID=3793723da705a07bf83ca0fad2a01fd3">Union</a>
to get some food with people. I went in and grabbed CJ's Chicken Tenders
and a cream soda and sat down to eat. I start eating the chicken tenders
one by one not really paying attention to what they looked like.
Finally, I got to the last one and noticed something strange about it.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/11/chicken-tender-21.jpg"><img alt="Chicken Tender

<p><strong>It looks like a PENIS!</strong></p>

<p>I thought It would be funny to put
<a href="http://qtjoel.com/2008/10/14/jason-tutoring/">Jason</a> on it. Just look
at his face! What a douche.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/11/chicken-tender-5.jpg"><img alt="Chicken Tender
(5)" src="../images/2008/11/chicken-tender-5-thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I still haven't eaten the penis-shaped chicken tender 'cause it seems
kind of awkward. It stuck it in the fridge and now its just sitting
there. Maybe someday someone will open it and eat it, not paying
attention to the shape of it, and we'll all laugh at him. Penis-eater.</p>

		<p>I woke up on Saturday around 3 o' clock in the afternoon and walked
downstairs to get some food. Then suddenly Clifford (my younger brother,

</p>

<p>I don't know how Cliff got my mom to get the dog. My mom used to always
complain about how they're such a hassle. They shed, shit and piss
everywhere. But I guess its kind of cool having one around.</p>

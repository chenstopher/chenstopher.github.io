		<h1><a href="../i-dont-remember-yesterday.html">I don’t remember yesterday</a></h1>
		<p>05 February 2011</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I think I suffered a concussion yesterday but I don’t remember. I’m
going to try and make a timeline of events to try to remember what I did
yesterday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I drove to Hunter Mountain. I vaguely remember how I got there.</p>
<p>I stopped at McDonalds. Not sure what I ordered. I remember going to the
restroom in there though.</p>
<p>Got to the mountain and parked the car somewhere near the six-person
lift. I then suited up and put on my new kneepads. Had to take a crap so
I went to the bathroom near the ticket counter, leaving my board on one
of the racks.</p>
<p>Went back to snowboarding and saw that the line for the six-person lift
was getting long so I went to the other lift. Thought to myself, “Shit
this lift is so slow.”</p>
<p>I remember going up the lift a couple times, but I only remember
snowboarding down once. And that was when I broke my binding strap.</p>
<p>Broke my binding strap by stepping on it while I was at the top of the
mountain. Rode down the mountain with a broken strap and thought to
myself, “It feels the same”. Brought it into the shop to get it fixed. I
said, “Do you guys have replacement straps for Flow bindings?”. She
said, “No but you can wait till my coworker gets back and we’ll see what
we can do. You can wait in here or come back later.” I said, “I’ll come
back later.” I went back later and the guy replaced the broken strap
with another strap. There was no hole for the screw on the replacement
strap so I said, “I don’t think it’ll fit”. He said, “I’ll make it fit”
and continued to drill a whole in the strap.</p>
<p>I don’t remember anything that happened after this.</p>
<p>I don’t remember the snow conditions.</p>
<p>I don’t remember doing any runs.</p>
<p>I don’t remember the lifts closing.</p>
<p>I don’t remember looking for my car.</p>
<p>I don’t remember taking off my snow gear.</p>
<p>I don’t remember driving off the mountain.</p>
<p>I remember that I was low on gas but I don’t remember getting gas. I
found a receipt in my wallet for \$75 worth of gas.</p>
<p>I remember drinking Iced Tea Lemonade but I don’t remember buying it.</p>
<p>I sort of remember driving home but I don’t remember what roads I took.</p>
<p>I think I ran a red light but I don’t remember.</p>
<p>I remember driving the car into the driveway, but not opening the gate.</p>
<p>I brought all my equipment in the house, to the basement.</p>
<p>Then, I went to bother my brother in his room.</p>
<p>I don’t remember taking off my contacts.</p>
<p>When my parents came home, I went to tell them that I don’t remember
anything. My mom said I called her multiple times (my phone’s call log
says 13). She said I called her once to tell her that I couldn’t find
the car. I don’t remember that. Another time I asked her what kind of
gas I should fill up the car with. I don’t remember that. She also said
she called me at around 4:20 to ask me where I was and I responded by
saying, “I don’t know who you are. Who are you? My head hurts.”</p>
<p>I ate some food, took some pills, and went to sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that is all I remember and don’t remember from yesterday. I woke up
today with the top of my head hurting and neck sore. I’m guessing I fell
while snowboarding, got a concussion, and am suffering from memory loss
but I don’t remember. It’s weird because the things I do remember feel
like they are parts of a dream. But I am sure it wasn’t just a dream
because I have the receipts from the gas and the drink I bought, and the
strap that the guy at the shop replaced.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the weirdest experience of my life.</p>

		<p>It is dumping snow outside.</p>
<p>I tried to build a snow fort today but I got bored after building one
wall.</p>
<p>Then Cliff decided to turn the stairs leading out the the backyard into
a ramp so he could snowboard off it, and he did.</p>
<p>Then he got tired and I buried him in snow and Chloe (our dog) almost
peed on him.</p>
<p>Finally, we went back inside and I tried to find a good movie to instant
watch on Netflix but I realized I’ve seen all of good ones already.</p>
<p>These seem like good captions for photos. Unfortunately, I don’t take
any.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for Wednesday.</p>

		<h1><a href="../polyphasic-fail.html">Polyphasic Fail</a></h1>
		<p>10 November 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I dropped my polyphasic sleep schedule.  I got through three weeks of
the Everyman schedule but it wasn’t working out cause I was over
sleeping too much.</p>
<p>On the last day, I went to take a 20 minute nap and woke up 19 hours
later.</p>
<p>So yeah. It’s back to the monophasic schedule for now. However, I plan
on trying a polyphasic schedule again sometime in the future. Maybe with
a partner so we can keep each other awake.</p>

		<h1><a href="../everyman-sleep-schedule-week-one.html">Everyman Sleep Schedule: Week One</a></h1>
		<p>26 October 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Surprisingly, the first day on the everyman schedule wasn’t so bad. I
followed the schedule pretty tightly. I always slept and woke when I
should’ve and everything went to plan. I did, however, expect to be way
more tired than I actually was. I never found myself falling asleep
during the day or having the urge to lie on my bed and just sleep for
the rest of the day. Overall, I’d say the first day went well.</p>
<p>The second day, however, was pretty horrible. I didn’t really have
anything to do till 13:00 after waking up at a 7:00 so was completely
bored out of my mind and drifting into zombie mode. I was so tired and
all I wanted to do was sleep. But I didn’t want to give up so I just
played a couple levels of Trine.</p>
<p>I overslept on a 20 minute nap on day three and another 20 minute nap on
day four because my alarm didn’t ring. However, I was still able to
follow the schedule as normal and didn’t have trouble sleeping though
I’m becoming paranoid of my alarm trying to sabotage my sleep schedule.</p>
<p>I overslept again on day five. This time it was the 3 hour core nap. I
think the alarm went off on time and I shut it off and went back to
sleep but I can’t say that I remember. I ended up waking up right before
when my first nap should start so I just slept for another 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Day six was a disaster. It was a Sunday and I decided to go catch the
matinee showing of the Social Network (good movie, by the way). It was
at 11:20 and ended around 14:00 so I missed my 12:XX nap. Walked around
with a couple of friends till 18:00 where I took a nap on the train.
Then I took my 23:XX nap and over slept one hour. Missing my first nap
was terrible.</p>
<p>And the last day went pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a pretty interesting week. The entire week I felt like a
zombie. You know when you pull an all nighter and you get to that time
of day where you are know you haven’t slept but don’t really feel tired
and everything feels like a dream? That’s what it felt like for me
except for the entire day.</p>
<p>For some reason, waking up from the 3 hour nap felt worse than the 20
minute ones. After waking from a 20 minute nap, I feel really refreshed
and any sleepiness I had before going into it is mostly gone. The
post-3-hour-nap, however, is Getting past the time after waking up from
the 3 hour nap is the hardest part. That 7:00 to 9:50/12:50 period is
just complete zombie mode. Like a zombie that just got shot with a
tranquilizer gun. A little caffeine helps me get through it, but it’s
still difficult.</p>
<p>I still more tired than using a monophasic sleep schedule but I’m hoping
to get used to the Everyman by the second week.</p>

		<h1><a href="../polyphasic-sleep-schedule.html">Polyphasic Sleep Schedule</a></h1>
		<p>18 October 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I’m planning on starting my polyphasic sleep schedule experiment thingy
today. If you’re unfamiliar with what that is then read up on it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">the
wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, rather than sleeping once a day for around 8 hours, I’ll be
breaking up my sleeping into multiple periods. There is less total sleep
time but more REM sleep time (theoretically). The most common polyphasic
sleep schedule is called the Uberman Sleep Schedule which breaks up your
sleep into twenty minute naps every four hours. I thought was way too
hardcore so I decided on the easier route, the <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Everyman+Sleep+Schedule">Everyman Sleep
Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>The Everyman Sleep Schedule is one three hour core “nap”, followed by
three twenty minute naps spread about five hours apart. There’s a bunch
of info on it
<a href="http://everything2.com/title/Everyman+Sleep+Schedule">here</a>, if you are
interested. I have it all planned out on Google calendar. Sleep from
4:00 – 7:00, 20 minute naps at 12:20, 18:55, and 23:20. Because of my
class schedule I won’t have exactly five hour gaps between each of my
naps but whatever.</p>
<p>What I’m planning to get out of this is more time to work on homework
and projects as well as feeling more rested. Yes, believe it or not,
this schedule is supposed to make you feel less tired and have more
energy. Not sure if this is true or not, but I guess we’ll find out
soon.</p>

		<p>Well this sucks.</p>
<p>I was tired so I went to take a nap at around 9:30 or so with my alarm
set to 11 hoping I'd wake up in time for the New Year countdown.</p>
<p>Didn't happen.</p>
<p>Ended up waking up at 12:01 (yes, exactly 12:01), saying "fuck", and
going back to sleep.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing a bunch of tennis these past few months using some
Volkl DNX 9 racquets that my dad bought. They’re fine but the handle was
too small for me and I thought it’d be cool to try out a new racquet so
I bought one. The Babolat AeroPro Drive to be exact.</p>
<p>This is actually the older model of the new AeroPro Drive Cortex. Rather
than paying \$185 for the newer version, I settled for the older one for
\$125 from <a href="http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpageRCBAB-BAPD.html">Tennis
Warehouse</a> and
had it strung with Prince Synthetic Gut Duraflex 16 gauge. I’m kind of a
noob at tennis so I did some research making sure the reviews were
awesome before I bought ‘em.</p>
<p>It arrived earlier today (8/6/09) and went out to play with it with
Georo, the same guy that is in <a href="http://www.chenstopher.com/snowboard-08/">my shitty snowboarding
videos</a>, and who also got a
new racquet today. Anyway, the AeroPro Drive is nice. The larger handle
is definitely better. It feels stiffer than the DNX 9’s I was using, not
sure if that’s good or bad. Ok, I’ll shut up now and put some more
pictures up.</p>

		<h1><a href="../christopher-chen.html">Christopher Chen</a></h1>
		<p>09 June 2009</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Sometimes I wish my name wasn’t Christopher Chen. It’s almost like the
combination of the two most popular names ever. I mean think of all the
Chris’ and Christophers you know and then think of all the Chens you
know. It’s a lot.</p>
<p>The main reason why I wish my name was a little more unique is so that I
can buy a domain name with my full name in it. When you see some dude’s
website url is like… dannychoo.com, you think to yourself, “Damn man,
this dude is the legit shit”. Then you go onto godaddy and check if your
name domain name is already taken. Turns out it is. And by some random
<a href="http://christopherchen.com/">asian american actor</a>.</p>
<p>Then you start thinking of derivatives of your name domain name.
chrischen.com, chris.chen.com, chrischen.net, christopherchen.net,
cchen.com, chenchris.com. But then you realize its just not the same and
there’s nothing you can do about it so you settle for chenstopher.com.</p>
<p>Another reason is that when I google my name, I don’t find me. I find a
shit load of random-ass doctors.</p>
<p>Whatever. I don’t really feeling like listing more reasons. At least it
isn’t, say, Hannan Butt. Just keeeeedddinggg.</p>

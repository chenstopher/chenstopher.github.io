		<h1><a href="../../../../post/hair-growth/">Hair Growth</a></h1>
		<p>15 November 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Wouldn’t it be interesting if hair grew up to a certain length and then
stopped? Imagine how our lives would be different. Would social status
would be based on the length of your hair? Would barbers exist? Would we
now have a new form of prejudice called hairism? What kind of
interesting hair products would be created from this? Would the average
male hair length be shorter or longer than female hair length?</p>
<p>This is the type of stuff I think about when I can’t sleep.</p>

<p>I just got a new set of headphones to replace the ones I broke <a href="http://www.chenstopher.com/birthday-20/" title="Birthday #20">the
other day</a>.
They’re the Audio Technica ATH-AD700’s and they are awesome. They look a
little weird with the purple/pink colored metal sides but they’re light,
comfortable, and sound great.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Guys! Check out <a href="http://wtfoodge.com">http://wtfoodge.com</a>! It’s the latest project that I’ve
been working on with Joel and Tamer. I guess its up now and Joel has
started posting. I don’t think I’ll be posting that often.</p>
<p>I spent a couple days working on it. I wanted to learn some more stuff
about webdesign like php and css. And I did. Also learned how to write
wordpress plugins. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Overall, I think the site looks pretty good. Although there is one thing
I feel that is kinda off and that is the right column. I don’t know if
its the colors or the picture. It just looks WEIRD. Maybe its cause that
shade of grey is too dull. I don’t know.</p>
<p>So guys, give me some critiques on the design of the site. Doesn’t
matter if its something bad, I just want to know what I can do to make
it better. Web design is fun.</p>
<p>And go check it out right now. <a href="http://wtfoodge.com">http://wtfoodge.com</a></p>
<p>One last thing. Internet Explorer freaking sucks. SUCKS.</p>

		<h1><a href="../../../../post/things-i-hate-reading/">Things I Hate: Reading</a></h1>
		<p>01 December 2008</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I hate reading. I don't find it interesting at all. And I don't get how
people can just sit down and read a entire book. I think it's the most
boring crap ever. I would rather sit around and do nothing than read a
book. That's how much it sucks.</p>
<p>I do this weird thing when I read. I'll be reading and then I'll start
thinking about something random word I read in the book. Then I'll stop
daydreaming and I'll be a page ahead from where I started daydreaming.
It's like I can daydream and read at the same time but I won't remember
anything that I read.</p>
<p>If they were subtitles to a movie I was watching, then I have no problem
reading that. But whenever I see pages and pages of huge blocks of text
and no pictures, I freaking hate it. I think its kind of like waiting in
a huge ass line for absolutely... NOTHING!</p>
<p>So yeah, sorry for making you read.</p>

<p>My mom wanted my old <a href="http://store.shopfujitsu.com/fpc/Ecommerce/buildseriesbean.do?series=T4220">Fujitsu

so she offered to get me another laptop for it. I took it. I’ve been

up ordering a MacBook ‘cause those things are only available on Macs,

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Yeah. I think I’m just gonna do C# and XNA game programming. Seems a
whole lot easier and I won’t have to manage memory.</p>
<p>Sure, C#/XNA is slower but I don’t think it matters when the games I
want to make are gonna be 2D. When I move on to 3D I think I’ll try
C++/DirectX again. I can’t really find any decent online resources for
DirectX right now and I don’t feel like buying a book.</p>
<p>I’ll probably take the game programming course here at Stony in a later
semester. The teacher is cool and having someone guide you through it is
a whole lot easier. Wish they had it when I was at Tech. Screw you weird
name people, Ariel and Aljohn. Oh and Lukasz.</p>
<p>This kid Allen(?) is starting up a game programming club so I’m gonna be
joining that. He seems pretty awesome at programming, much more
knowledgeable than I who only knows Java and a bit of C++ (and
php/html/css/js). It’ll be fun. I hope.</p>
<p>So anyway, I’ve starting learning C# and it’s a lot like Java. That’s
kind of a good thing since Java’s pretty easy. Still deciding on game to
start off with.</p>
<p>Snake? Space Invaders? Tetris? PONG?!</p>
<p>For the sake of randomness. Here’s a video of one of the <a href="http://tigsource.com/articles/2007/06/11/nikujin">best games

		<p>So I was sitting around yesterday bored out of my mind. Seriously. I
started staring at the fish on my desktop.</p>
<p><img alt="desktop-the-fish" src="../../../../images/2009/03/desktopthefish2.jpg" title="desktop-the-fish" /></p>
<p>I was trying to look for something to do. Searched DC++ for some games
to play, didn’t really work. Tried to watch a movie, wasn’t in the mood.
Do homework? It was a Saturday. No one does homework on Saturday.</p>
<p>Then I thought, I kinda want to learn Blender and 3D modeling and
texturing. You know, do some animation and game programming. If I wanted
to do animation, I’d have to learn some video editing. And for game
programming, I’d have to learn DirectX programming and more C++. So, I
ended up making a list of stuff I wanted to learn.</p>
<h2>The List</h2>
<ul>
<li>DirectX</li>
<li>Advanced Game Programming</li>
<li>More C++</li>
<li>Blender/3D Modeling/Textures</li>
<li>Basic Animation</li>
<li>Basic Video Editing</li>
<li>iPhone App Development</li>
<li>Android Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah that’s a lot of stuff but it’ll give me something to do if I ever
fall into “help I’m bored out of my mind” state again. If it ever does
happen I can just refer to the list and google up some tutorials.</p>
<p>I tried to start learning Blender but Windows 7 had some problems with
it and I didn’t feel like booting up the Vista partition. So I just
spent the rest of the day doing nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah I know. I’m lazy. I should probably actually try to accomplish
stuff on the list instead of just making one for fun but you know what?
Screw you. Just keeeeding. Haha.</p>
<p>I think I’ll start with DirectX/Game/C++.</p>

		<h1><a href="../../../../post/oh-noez-no-space-on-the-server/">Oh noez, no space on the server</a></h1>
		<p>08 January 2009</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>A couple years ago I had this awesome idea to build a home file server
and back up all my DVDs and media onto it. I would also have HTPCs
connected to each TV in the house that way we would be able to access
all my movies and music. We also have a home theater room with a
projection screen and I planned to connect a HTPC to that as well. It
seemed like the perfect plan.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Now fast forward to today. I have a 2TB server with only 146GB of free
space. Only one of the three TV’s have a HTPC connected to it. And the
home theater room is computer-less.</p>
<p>Yeah, wtf?</p>
<h2>The Problem:</h2>
<p>The HTPC’s connected to the TV’s aren’t really much a problem. Just
laziness.</p>
<p>However, the lack of space on the server is. Backing up DVDs takes up A
LOT of space and A LOT of time. Each DVD, menus and extras stripped,
takes up about 4 and half gigs and from 10 minutes to an hour to back
up. I have over 300 DVDs. Let’s look at the math:</p>
<p><strong>300 DVDs * 4.5 GB/DVD = 1350 gigs!</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so you’re saying that doesn’t doesn’t take up all of the 2TB of
space. But I have other things on there as well. A crap load of shows,
game ISOs, music, pictures and backups. All that is about 900GB.</p>
<p><strong>1350GB + 900GB = 2.250TB > 2TB!</strong> I don’t have enough space.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could convert the DVDs to a compressed format but do you have
any idea how long that would take? Let’s say it takes 20 minutes to rip
a DVD.</p>
<p><strong>300 DVDs * 20 minutes/DVD = 6000 minutes = 100 hours = 4.16 days.</strong>
Ok, that’s not so bad. I’ve already copied about 3/4th of them.</p>
<p>Now lets see the time it would take to encode them to… h264 mkv.</p>
<p><strong>300 DVDs * 90 minutes/DVD = 27,000 minutes = 450 hours = 18.75
days!</strong></p>
<p>And that’s not including the time it would take to set it up. In total
it would take me <strong>about 23 days</strong> to copy and encode all of them. 23
days straight! Non-stop! That’s freaking crazy! So what do I do?</p>
<h2>The Solution:</h2>
<p>Well I guess the easiest way would be to UPGRADE THE SERVER! Yay!</p>
<p>I’ve been looking for a way to easily add more hard drives of different
sizes and still have some sort of data redundancy. Plus I kind of want
to get rid of the RAID array and just use JBOD (Just a bunch of disks).</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx">Windows Home
Server</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Windows for uh.. a home server. Adding space is easy, just
connect the drive and add it to the WHS “data pool”. Client computers
can then access the data. There’s file duplication which copies the the
data over multiple drives for redundancy. Unlike using a RAID array,
where all hard drives have to be the same size, WHS allows hard drives
of different sizes just like JBOD. WHS is better than JBOD due to the
fact that if the rest of the your computer dies, your data is lost with
it. With WHS, you are able to just reinstall the OS and add the drives
to the “data pool” and all is good. There are also add-ins and more cool
stuff.</p>
<p>One tiny problem though. The RAID controller I’m using is totally out of
SATA slots so I can’t add anymore drives to the RAID array. And the case
I’m using is out of drive bays so I can’t add more SATA controllers. I
have a couple of options.</p>
<h4>Option 1:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Buy some 1TB drives</li>
<li>Copy data from RAID array to new 1TB drives</li>
<li>Install WHS</li>
<li>Delete RAID array</li>
<li>Remove some of the older 320GB drives to free up SATA slots</li>
<li>Connect new 1TB drives to free SATA slots</li>
<li>Add to “data pool”</li>
<li>Drink coke and watch movies!</li>
</ol>
<h4>Option 2:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Buy a bigger case, SATA controller, and some 1TB drives</li>
<li>Rebuild server in new case</li>
<li>Install WHS</li>
<li>Delete RAID array</li>
<li>Use RAID controller as SATA controller</li>
<li>Add existing drives to "data pool"</li>
<li>Install new SATA controller</li>
<li>Add new drives to "data pool"</li>
<li>Drink coke and watch movies!</li>
</ol>
<h4>Option 3:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Buy and build new server using old drives + new drives</li>
<li>Convert existing server to Left 4 Dead gaming machine!</li>
<li>Drink coke and play Left 4 Dead!</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m leaning towards option 3. Hehe.</p>
<p>I just want to make the home file server easier to manage and more
flexible. I think Windows Home Server will help with that and maybe a
new case. Hot swappable drive bays would be nice too so I don’t to open
up the case every time I want to add a new drive.</p>
<p>Well, I’m gonna go do some more research.</p>

		<p>I think <a href="http://tokyoflash.com">Tokyoflash</a> has the coolest watches
ever. They're kinda high-tech and futuristic-looking and imported from
JAPAN! We all know Japan makes the coolest shit.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../images/2008/12/oberon.jpg"><img alt="oberon" src="../../../../images/2008/12/oberon-thumb.jpg" /></a>
The watch on the right is called the S-Mode Oberon. It's the one I got
after I broke my G-shock watch. The outer ring is hours, inner most ring
is tens digit of the minutes, and the one in the middle is the ones
digit. When I first got it, it took forever to figure out what time it
was but then I got used to it. Its cool because other people can't tell
what time it is. It's probably the coolest watch I ever had minus this
Power Rangers watch I had when I was little.</p>
<p>Check it out in action (skip to 2:30):</p>

<p>But I broke the strap it some freak freebording accident and I still
haven't gotten it fixed. I'll probably get it fixed over the winter
break(SNOWBOARD 08!!!!!!) or maybe I'll just give it to my brother as a
present. I want to get another one but they're so freaking expensive.</p>
<p>I hate not having a watch and not knowing what time it is.</p>

<p>Installed the in-wall Z-Wave switch for my bedroom lights today. It's this little device that sits behind the
light switch in the junction box and allows you to turn any light switch into a Z-Wave connected one. That's
nice cause I like the way my light switches look. Most of the Z-Wave enabled switches I've seen look like crap.</p>
<p>I've installed light switches before, but I was a little afraid when hooking up this device. If I hooked it up
incorrectly, I could've blown it up and I'd be out $35. Or worst case scenario my apartment burns down.
So I made sure to triple check my wiring with the documentation before turning the breaker back on.</p>
<p>In the end, it went pretty smoothly. I did have an issue with the light status not reporting correctly when I
flipped the physical switch but that was just a configuration problem. I had to make sure to set the association
groups for the device so that it would report the status back to the controller.</p>
<p>Next step is installing these for the rest of my lights. And then maybe figuring out how to get my ancient AC
units connected to the system.</p>

		<p>I've been thinking about implementing some home automation in my apartment for a while
now. I've always wanted to be able to control my lights, blinds, ac, fan, etc using 
just my phone. So I finally got off my butt and started working on it.</p>
<p>After doing some research, I ordered 
a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X0AWA6E">Z-Stick</a>,
a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007UZH7B8">Z-Wave switch</a>,
and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008VWBNAU">Z-Wave in-wall relay</a>.
I also had a spare Raspberry PI collecting dust so I decided to use that 
as the server. I'll probably pick up some more devices later on to connect the 
rest of my apartment if things go well.</p>
<p>Originally I was gonna write some server software to handle the all this stuff but then 
I found out about <a href="http://www.openhab.org/">openHAB</a>. It's this open source automation 
software that seems pretty popular. I figured there's no point reinventing the wheel so
I went with that and installed it on my rPI.</p>
<p>And so after a couple hours of wtfs I finally got one of the lights working! Check out the 
video.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">

                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>It was actually super exciting the first time it flipped on. It's been a while since I got
to work on something fun like this. I can't wait till I get all the other stuff installed.</p>

		<p>I rebuilt my site using <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">pelican</a>. I wanted to simplify things
a bit so I switched from using Wordpress to a static site generator. I picked pelican cause
I already knew some python and the feature set seemed decent. It has a wordpress importer
which sped things up a bit.</p>
<p>The source for this site is on <a href="https://github.com/chenstopher/chenstopher-blog">github</a> 
if you'd like to take a peek. The <a href="https://github.com/chenstopher/pelican-smpl">theme</a> is
on github too.</p>
<p>And since the entire site is static (no db, no server-side scripting), I can host this on 
<a href="https://github.com/chenstopher/chenstopher.github.io">github pages</a>. Which is prettttttty
awesome because now I don't need to pay and fiddle around with a webhost.</p>
<p>Hope nothing is broken.</p>

<p>Here is a non-random list of stuff about this keyboard:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">I built this keyboard.</span></li>
<li>It was fun.</li>
<li>I got the parts from <a href="http://massdrop.com" title="Massdrop">Massdrop</a>.</li>
<li>It was my first time soldering.</li>
<li>I messed up some of the soldering as you can see from the pics. But
    everything works!</li>
<li>It has Cherry MX Clear switches. I'm not sure if I like them. Too
    heavy. I think I'm gonna switch 'em.</li>
<li>I wish there was another column of keys so my "|\" key isn't in a
    stupid place.</li>
<li>My WPM dropped since using the Ergodox. I blame the Clear switches.</li>
<li>But it's pretty comfortable.</li>
<li>Building this was the nerdiest (geekiest?) thing I have ever done in
    my life.</li>

<p>Here it is. The completed final project for my computer graphics course.</p>
<p>Updates</p>
<ul>
<li>Textures stolen from <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/26727-johnsmith-texture-pack-v93-32x-124-with-customizer-0324/">JohnSmith Texture Pack</a> for Minecraft (please don't sue me)</li>
<li>Trees!</li>
<li>Awesomer caves</li>
<li>Better lighting</li>
<li>Faster (~350 FPS if chunks aren't loading)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/417221/voxelterrain.zip">Download here</a>, if you
want to play around with it. However, I can't guarantee it will work
with your machine cause the only ones I've tested it on is my desktop
and my laptop. And both are pretty beefy machines. So, good luck.</p>
<p>AH! FINALS.</p>

<p>I had to demo my progress to my professor this week so I worked on it a
lot. Some changes I made are:</p>
<p><strong>"Infinite" terrain</strong>. The world is now made of chunks of voxels. I add
and remove chunks from a chunk buffer so that only chunks around the
player are actually loaded and drawn. The generating is done
asynchronously so it doesn't kill the framerate.

<p>So I just started working on this procedurally generated voxel/boxel
terrain thing for my computer graphics final project. The above screen
shot is what it looks like after a couple hours of work. That's a
200x200 grid. And yes, sadly, that is 19 frames per second.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm just generating the terrain using 2D Perlin noise stored
in a heightmap. Using a heightmap isn't really ideal since I can't
really use it to store caves or overhangs. Eventually I'm going to
update that to an octtree and use some combination of 3D Perlin noise
stuff for generating the map.</p>
<p>For drawing, I just draw every single block which pretty much explains
the 19 FPS. I have some ideas for optimizing it, such as only drawing
blocks that are inside the view frustum and only drawing faces that are
touching empty blocks, but I haven't gotten around to doing that. My
OpenGL skills aren't there yet.</p>
<p>I'll post some more when I have more to show.</p>

<p>Here is an unfinished mockup of a game I started making. The concept was
pretty much tetris but you don't control the tetrominoes directly. You
control a little construction robot worker that can catch, carry, and
throw them. There would be a evil dude in the crane that would be
dropping pieces to mess you up.</p>
<p>I started working on the game a few week ago. Currently, the player can
run around, jump, pick up pieces, and throw pieces. It's not really in a
playable state and I don't think I'm going to continue working on it.
After implementing those basic player mechanics, I realized it wasn't
that much fun. So I'm scraping it.</p>
<p>For me, the actual purpose of the project was to learn how to implement
and use a entity-component system. It's a system where game entities are
made up of different components (health, position, spatial) rather than
being subclasses of a parent entity. I got that part of the game working
so I guess it was worth working on.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll pick this up again at a later time. Probably not.</p>

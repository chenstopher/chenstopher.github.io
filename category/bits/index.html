<p>Here is a non-random list of stuff about this keyboard:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">I built this keyboard.</span></li>
<li>It was fun.</li>
<li>I got the parts from <a href="http://massdrop.com" title="Massdrop">Massdrop</a>.</li>
<li>It was my first time soldering.</li>
<li>I messed up some of the soldering as you can see from the pics. But
    everything works!</li>
<li>It has Cherry MX Clear switches. I'm not sure if I like them. Too
    heavy. I think I'm gonna switch 'em.</li>
<li>I wish there was another column of keys so my "|\" key isn't in a
    stupid place.</li>
<li>My WPM dropped since using the Ergodox. I blame the Clear switches.</li>
<li>But it's pretty comfortable.</li>
<li>Building this was the nerdiest (geekiest?) thing I have ever done in
    my life.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here it is. The completed final project for my computer graphics course.</p>
<p>Updates</p>
<ul>
<li>Textures stolen from <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/26727-johnsmith-texture-pack-v93-32x-124-with-customizer-0324/">JohnSmith Texture Pack</a> for Minecraft (please don't sue me)</li>
<li>Trees!</li>
<li>Awesomer caves</li>
<li>Better lighting</li>
<li>Faster (~350 FPS if chunks aren't loading)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/417221/voxelterrain.zip">Download here</a>, if you
want to play around with it. However, I can't guarantee it will work
with your machine cause the only ones I've tested it on is my desktop
and my laptop. And both are pretty beefy machines. So, good luck.</p>
<p>AH! FINALS.</p>

<p>I had to demo my progress to my professor this week so I worked on it a
lot. Some changes I made are:</p>
<p><strong>"Infinite" terrain</strong>. The world is now made of chunks of voxels. I add
and remove chunks from a chunk buffer so that only chunks around the
player are actually loaded and drawn. The generating is done
asynchronously so it doesn't kill the framerate.

<p>So I just started working on this procedurally generated voxel/boxel
terrain thing for my computer graphics final project. The above screen
shot is what it looks like after a couple hours of work. That's a
200x200 grid. And yes, sadly, that is 19 frames per second.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm just generating the terrain using 2D Perlin noise stored
in a heightmap. Using a heightmap isn't really ideal since I can't
really use it to store caves or overhangs. Eventually I'm going to
update that to an octtree and use some combination of 3D Perlin noise
stuff for generating the map.</p>
<p>For drawing, I just draw every single block which pretty much explains
the 19 FPS. I have some ideas for optimizing it, such as only drawing
blocks that are inside the view frustum and only drawing faces that are
touching empty blocks, but I haven't gotten around to doing that. My
OpenGL skills aren't there yet.</p>
<p>I'll post some more when I have more to show.</p>

<p>Here is an unfinished mockup of a game I started making. The concept was
pretty much tetris but you don't control the tetrominoes directly. You
control a little construction robot worker that can catch, carry, and
throw them. There would be a evil dude in the crane that would be
dropping pieces to mess you up.</p>
<p>I started working on the game a few week ago. Currently, the player can
run around, jump, pick up pieces, and throw pieces. It's not really in a
playable state and I don't think I'm going to continue working on it.
After implementing those basic player mechanics, I realized it wasn't
that much fun. So I'm scraping it.</p>
<p>For me, the actual purpose of the project was to learn how to implement
and use a entity-component system. It's a system where game entities are
made up of different components (health, position, spatial) rather than
being subclasses of a parent entity. I got that part of the game working
so I guess it was worth working on.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll pick this up again at a later time. Probably not.</p>

		<p>18 November 2011</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>So I had an interview for an job yesterday. In fact, it was my first job
interview. It went okay.</p>
<p>One of the technical questions the interviewer asked was to create a
data structure that would insert in O(log n) and return an iterator that
would iterate the data back in sorted order in O(n) time. I knew it was
a binary tree and the iterator would use an inorder traversal of the
tree so I started typing it out.</p>
<p>But when I got to the iterator part, I just couldn't figure it out.  I
knew for sure it was an inorder traversal but I couldn't figure out how
to turn the recursive algorithm that I knew into an iterative one. So I
sat there and drew some trees to try and visualize the algorithm for it.
I thought using a stack for the traversal would also probably work but I
couldn't figure that out either. And then time was up.</p>
<p>So we continued the interview. I asked some questions about the
position. Then the interview ended.</p>
<p>I hung around for a little bit with a friend that worked there and
referred me for the job then we biked back to our dorms. As soon as I
got back I opened up Visual Studio and worked on the problem again
because I knew that if I didn't I'd probably end up staying up all night
thinking about it.</p>
<p>It figured it out in ten minutes.</p>
<p>Coding under pressure, man. Can't do it.</p>

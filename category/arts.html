<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124052/">City of Life and Death</a>, a film
about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre">Nanjing
Massacre</a>.</p>
<p>This movie is disturbing.  I don't even know how any one could do such
horrific things to another human being. What makes this even more
disturbing is that the events depicted in the movie do not even compare
to what actually happened during the massacre.</p>
<p>Seriously. Watch this movie. Then go look up Nanjing Massacre on
Wikipedia.</p>

		<p>04 February 2012</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Went movie hopping today and saw four movies.</p>
<p>The first movie was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/">Chronicle</a>.
This one was unexpectedly good. I was going into this thinking that it
would be another crappy teens with super power movie (see Jumper) but
man was I surprised.</p>
<p>Then I went over to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596365/">The Woman in
Black</a>. It was a solid ghost story
but had your typical horror movie scare tactics. I liked it though. The
only thing that slightly bothered me was Daniel Radcliffe's role as a
father. I couldn't help thinking, "THIS GUY IS HARRY POTTER DAMN IT."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1601913/">The Grey</a> was the third one and
definitely my favorite out of the ones I watched today. Just a great
story about survival and the toll it takes on human beings. It reminded
me a lot of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106246/">Alive</a>, a similar
movie that I liked. It was even referenced by one of the characters in
The Grey.</p>
<p>Watched<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229238/">Mission Impossible: Ghost
Protocol</a> last. I missed the first
couple minutes cause I  was waiting for the after credits scene for The
Grey. I don't usually like action movies like these, but it was
entertaining. Good action scenes, awesome gadgets, and a bit of humor
here and there.</p>
<p>I think I could've did one more but there was nothing good to watch and
I was tired of eating gummy bears and Milk Duds.</p>
<p>Note to future Chris: Do this again.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>If you have a Netflix account and you want to watch something that makes
you feel like an insignificant speck of nothing, go watch <em>Into the
Universe with Stephen Hawking</em>.</p>
<p>The last episode is especially depressing. In it, he talks about all the
different ways everything can end. Black hole sucks us in. Asteroid
comes by and blows us up. The sun runs out of fuel. Another galaxy
crashes into ours.</p>
<p>While all that stuff won't happen in my lifetime (probably), it made me
think about all the awesome space things that I won't be able to
experience within my lifetime. Traveling to another habitable planet,
for one.</p>
<p>It's mind blowing just how insignificant we are in both size and time.</p>

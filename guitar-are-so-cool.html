		<p>I haven't played my guitar in quite a while. I don't know what happened,
I just kind of lost interest in it. Sometimes I pick it up and play some
stuff but otherwise it just sits in the corner of my room collecting
dust.</p>


<p>I don't really remember when I first started playing. I think it was
just random thing I wanted to learn to do. So I went online and bought
one. I remember the first day I got it, I played with it almost the
whole day. It wasn't any good. I never really practiced much either. I'd
go online and download some tabs and learn my favorite parts to songs
that I've been listening to. It was a good way to waste time.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would go to my friends house and we would play. We really
sucked. We tried starting a band but that was an epic fail. We didn't
have a drummer. When we did find one and finally had a band meet, I
wasn't there. And after that the band never met up again. That was in
junior high. We all went to different high schools and I moved to
Brooklyn.</p>
<p>I haven't really played after that. Sometimes I hear a song in a movie
or something, look up the tabs and try to play it but end up just giving
up cause its too hard.</p>

<p>I love watching people jam. It's so cool. When I see them I think to
myself, "Shit, if I had practiced a crap load more I'd be as awesome as
them". Shit, guitars are so cool.</p>

		<p>30 June 2015</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I've been thinking about implementing some home automation in my apartment for a while
now. I've always wanted to be able to control my lights, blinds, ac, fan, etc using 
just my phone. So I finally got off my butt and started working on it.</p>
<p>After doing some research, I ordered 
a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X0AWA6E">Z-Stick</a>,
a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007UZH7B8">Z-Wave switch</a>,
and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008VWBNAU">Z-Wave in-wall relay</a>.
I also had a spare Raspberry PI collecting dust so I decided to use that 
as the server. I'll probably pick up some more devices later on to connect the 
rest of my apartment if things go well.</p>
<p>Originally I was gonna write some server software to handle the all this stuff but then 
I found out about <a href="http://www.openhab.org/">openHAB</a>. It's this open source automation 
software that seems pretty popular. I figured there's no point reinventing the wheel so
I went with that and installed it on my rPI.</p>
<p>And so after a couple hours of wtfs I finally got one of the lights working! Check out the 
video.</p>

                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>It was actually super exciting the first time it flipped on. It's been a while since I got
to work on something fun like this. I can't wait till I get all the other stuff installed.</p>

		<p>I rebuilt my site using <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">pelican</a>. I wanted to simplify things
a bit so I switched from using Wordpress to a static site generator. I picked pelican cause
I already knew some python and the feature set seemed decent. It has a wordpress importer
which sped things up a bit.</p>
<p>The source for this site is on <a href="https://github.com/chenstopher/chenstopher-blog">github</a> 
if you'd like to take a peek. The <a href="https://github.com/chenstopher/pelican-smpl">theme</a> is
on github too.</p>
<p>And since the entire site is static (no db, no server-side scripting), I can host this on 
<a href="https://github.com/chenstopher/chenstopher.github.io">github pages</a>. Which is prettttttty
awesome because now I don't need to pay and fiddle around with a webhost.</p>
<p>Hope nothing is broken.</p>

<p>I ordered a pair of shoes last week that was slated to arrive Monday.
They never showed up. So I checked the UPS tracking info to see what the
heck happened. It just said, "The package was missed at the UPS
facility, UPS will deliver on the next business day". Thinking that
they'd just deliver the thing tomorrow (like it said in the message), I
just put it off as some UPS nonsense and decided to wait for it to
arrive on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tuesday comes, doesn't show up. Wednesday, doesn't show up. Each day the
UPS tracking info page updates at 10:00 pm saying the same exact
message: "The package was missed at the UPS facility, UPS will deliver
on the next business day."Â Surely, something must have gone wrong. I
give Zappos a call and they say to just wait it out and if it doesn't
arrive, just give them another call.</p>
<p>So I wait another day and guess what.. the shoes still haven't arrived.
I call up Zappos again, explain my situation, and the guy says they'll
just send another pair free of charge (btw, great customer support). The
very second I get off the phone, some guy comes to the door and rings
the bell. It's the UPS guy. With my shoes. That I ordered last week.</p>
<p>I end up calling Zappos for the third time to explain my matter of great
coincidental timing and tell them to cancel that order they made just
two minutes prior.</p>
<p>So that's my exciting ordering shoes online story.</p>

		<p>Some guy I used to be good friends with instant-messaged me today. It
was totally unexpected and weird and cool. Sent me down this spiral of
looking up people from my past (which was difficult cause I don't
use/have facebook). It was strange seeing people I haven't even thought
about in years again. It was depressing.</p>
<p>I had this theory when I was kid that when you flew on an airplane to
some destination on the other side of the planet, that the airplane
wasn't actually moving, but the world outside was being reconstructed
into the destination. Further places took longer because the landscapes,
cultures, people were more different than places closer to where you
were currently. What a stupid fucking self-centered idea.</p>
<p>Note to past Chris: you are/were stupid. Note to future Chris: do
something.</p>

<p>Here is a non-random list of stuff about this keyboard:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">I built this keyboard.</span></li>
<li>It was fun.</li>
<li>I got the parts from <a href="http://massdrop.com" title="Massdrop">Massdrop</a>.</li>
<li>It was my first time soldering.</li>
<li>I messed up some of the soldering as you can see from the pics. But
    everything works!</li>
<li>It has Cherry MX Clear switches. I'm not sure if I like them. Too
    heavy. I think I'm gonna switch 'em.</li>
<li>I wish there was another column of keys so my "|\" key isn't in a
    stupid place.</li>
<li>My WPM dropped since using the Ergodox. I blame the Clear switches.</li>
<li>But it's pretty comfortable.</li>
<li>Building this was the nerdiest (geekiest?) thing I have ever done in
    my life.</li>

<p>Here it is. The completed final project for my computer graphics course.</p>
<p>Updates</p>
<ul>
<li>Textures stolen from <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/26727-johnsmith-texture-pack-v93-32x-124-with-customizer-0324/">JohnSmith Texture Pack</a> for Minecraft (please don't sue me)</li>
<li>Trees!</li>
<li>Awesomer caves</li>
<li>Better lighting</li>
<li>Faster (~350 FPS if chunks aren't loading)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/417221/voxelterrain.zip">Download here</a>, if you
want to play around with it. However, I can't guarantee it will work
with your machine cause the only ones I've tested it on is my desktop
and my laptop. And both are pretty beefy machines. So, good luck.</p>
<p>AH! FINALS.</p>

<p>I had to demo my progress to my professor this week so I worked on it a
lot. Some changes I made are:</p>
<p><strong>"Infinite" terrain</strong>. The world is now made of chunks of voxels. I add
and remove chunks from a chunk buffer so that only chunks around the
player are actually loaded and drawn. The generating is done
asynchronously so it doesn't kill the framerate.

		<h1><a href="../update-on-dvorak.html">Update on Dvorak</a></h1>
		<p>14 September 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I am sad to say that I haven't really reached my goal of 100 wpm yet.
Right now, the fastest I can type with Dvorak is around 70-80 wpm. It's
close but not quite there. The one thing that I've found increasing
annoying with my use of Dvorak is the extra focus on the right pinky.
Both the L and S keys are pressed with the right pinky. When I'm typing
for long periods on time, it really stresses out my right pinky and
causes some pain. In fact, I feel like I use my right fingers way more
than the left ones and often have to take breaks from typing cause my
right arm hurts. The only time I need to move my left fingers up and
down rows is to type punctuation or some other less common letters. But
its the opposite for my right hand. I feel like its all over the place
and the balance is all lopsided.</p>
<p>Just recently I came across another keyboard layout called Colemak. I've
actually known about it since I discovered Dvorak but didn't really look
into it but I was trying not to fall asleep today in my EUR201 class and
decided to do some research on Colemak. The change in Colemak isn't
nearly as drastic as Dvorak. Many of the keys are in the same place as
QWERTY and I think only around 17 key positions moved. Plus, the Ctrl
ZXCV shortcut keys are all in the same place unlike Dvorak, where I have
to use to take my hand off the mouse to use them. There also isn't the L
and S pinky problem like in Dvorak. I'm thinking about trying out
Colemak during the next break from school to see how it is. Hopefully
it'll get rid of the right hand pain but I guess I'll just stick with
Dvorak for now.</p>
<p>Oh and I set my Caps Lock key to Backspace and replaced the Context Menu
key with Caps Lock. Seeing how I don't really use Caps Lock and never
use the Context Menu key, I thought it would be nice to have the
Backspace at a better location on the keyboard.</p>

		<h1><a href="../dvorak.html">DVORAK</a></h1>
		<p>20 January 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Last time I tried to learn dvorak, it was a complete failure. I was
typing way too slow and I had work to complete so I just gave up on it.
I've decided to try and learn it again mainly because I was completely
bored out of my mind but also cause I've been starting to feel some pain
in my fingers. Dvorak is supposed to be "healthier" for your fingers or
something cause you don't have to move your fingers as much.</p>
<p>I already had my desktop keyboard switched to dvorak. I wanted to
seriously learn it this time so I even converted my Macbook's keys to
dvorak. Wasn't too hard. Just popped them off with a tiny screw driver
and put them back in the correct order. Now people who want to use my
computer won't be able to because all the keys are in the wrong places.
Awesome!</p>

<p>I've been playing typeracer everyday since I've switched over to speed
up my typing. Right now I'm typing at around 40 wpm (vs 80wpm when I was
using qwerty) which isn't too bad considering I've only been using
dvorak for four days. But I feel like a noob cause I have to keep
looking at the keys. The most annoying thing about dvorak is that all
the shortcut keys are now on the other side of the keyboard. Ctrl-c,
ctrl-v, ctrl-s, ctrl-z are all on the right side. Also I keep typing
"ass" when I want to type "all" because the 's' is now where the 'l'
used to be. Kind of annoying</p>
<p>That's all for now. Off to play some more typeracer. I'll revisit this
when my typing speed reaches 100+ wpm.</p>

day and came across this song again. I just want to say that this is the
greatest song in the universe and Michael Bolton has the most intense

<p>I’ve been playing a bunch of tennis these past few months using some
Volkl DNX 9 racquets that my dad bought. They’re fine but the handle was
too small for me and I thought it’d be cool to try out a new racquet so
I bought one. The Babolat AeroPro Drive to be exact.</p>
<p>This is actually the older model of the new AeroPro Drive Cortex. Rather
than paying \$185 for the newer version, I settled for the older one for
\$125 from <a href="http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpageRCBAB-BAPD.html">Tennis
Warehouse</a> and
had it strung with Prince Synthetic Gut Duraflex 16 gauge. I’m kind of a
noob at tennis so I did some research making sure the reviews were
awesome before I bought ‘em.</p>
<p>It arrived earlier today (8/6/09) and went out to play with it with
Georo, the same guy that is in <a href="http://www.chenstopher.com/snowboard-08/">my shitty snowboarding
videos</a>, and who also got a
new racquet today. Anyway, the AeroPro Drive is nice. The larger handle
is definitely better. It feels stiffer than the DNX 9’s I was using, not
sure if that’s good or bad. Ok, I’ll shut up now and put some more
pictures up.</p>

		<h1><a href="../../../post/inorder-tree-traversal/">Inorder Tree Traversal</a></h1>
		<p>18 November 2011</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>So I had an interview for an job yesterday. In fact, it was my first job
interview. It went okay.</p>
<p>One of the technical questions the interviewer asked was to create a
data structure that would insert in O(log n) and return an iterator that
would iterate the data back in sorted order in O(n) time. I knew it was
a binary tree and the iterator would use an inorder traversal of the
tree so I started typing it out.</p>
<p>But when I got to the iterator part, I just couldn't figure it out. Â I
knew for sure it was an inorder traversal but I couldn't figure out how
to turn the recursive algorithm that I knew into an iterative one. So I
sat there and drew some trees to try and visualize the algorithm for it.
I thought using a stack for the traversal would also probably work but I
couldn't figure that out either. And then time was up.</p>
<p>So we continued the interview. I asked some questions about the
position. Then the interview ended.</p>
<p>I hung around for a little bit with a friend that worked there and
referred me for the job then we biked back to our dorms. As soon as I
got back I opened up Visual Studio and worked on the problem again
because I knew that if I didn't I'd probably end up staying up all night
thinking about it.</p>
<p>It figured it out in ten minutes.</p>
<p>Coding under pressure, man. Can't do it.</p>

		<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Universe">The Restaurant at the End of the
Universe</a>
by Douglas Adams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is known that there is an infinite number of worlds, simply because
there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not
every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite
number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is
as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all
the planets in the universe can be said to be zero. From this it
follows that the population of the universe is also zero, and that any
people you may meet from time to time are merely the product of a
deranged imagination.</p>

		<p>If you have a Netflix account and you want to watch something that makes
you feel like an insignificant speck of nothing, go watch <em>Into the
Universe with Stephen Hawking</em>.</p>
<p>The last episode is especially depressing. In it, he talks about all the
different ways everything can end. Black hole sucks us in. Asteroid
comes by and blows us up. The sun runs out of fuel. Another galaxy
crashes into ours.</p>
<p>While all that stuff won't happen in my lifetime (probably), it made me
think about all the awesome space things that I won't be able to
experience within my lifetime. Traveling to another habitable planet,
for one.</p>
<p>It's mind blowing just how insignificant we are in both size and time.</p>

		<p>I just spent three hours trying to fall asleep. I even tried listening
to NPR to bore myself to sleep but that didn't work. So now I'm just
gonna stay awake till my 8 o' clock morning class.</p>
<p>Ironically, I watched
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278504/" title="Insomnia (2002)">Insomnia</a> prior
to going to bed. Good movie, but maybe I shouldn't have watched it.</p>

		<p>06 March 2009</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Yeah. I think I’m just gonna do C# and XNA game programming. Seems a
whole lot easier and I won’t have to manage memory.</p>
<p>Sure, C#/XNA is slower but I don’t think it matters when the games I
want to make are gonna be 2D. When I move on to 3D I think I’ll try
C++/DirectX again. I can’t really find any decent online resources for
DirectX right now and I don’t feel like buying a book.</p>
<p>I’ll probably take the game programming course here at Stony in a later
semester. The teacher is cool and having someone guide you through it is
a whole lot easier. Wish they had it when I was at Tech. Screw you weird
name people, Ariel and Aljohn. Oh and Lukasz.</p>
<p>This kid Allen(?) is starting up a game programming club so I’m gonna be
joining that. He seems pretty awesome at programming, much more
knowledgeable than I who only knows Java and a bit of C++ (and
php/html/css/js). It’ll be fun. I hope.</p>
<p>So anyway, I’ve starting learning C# and it’s a lot like Java. That’s
kind of a good thing since Java’s pretty easy. Still deciding on game to
start off with.</p>
<p>Snake? Space Invaders? Tetris? PONG?!</p>
<p>For the sake of randomness. Here’s a video of one of the <a href="http://tigsource.com/articles/2007/06/11/nikujin">best games
ever</a>.</p>

		<p>01 March 2009</p>

		<p>So I was sitting around yesterday bored out of my mind. Seriously. I
started staring at the fish on my desktop.</p>
<p><img alt="desktop-the-fish" src="../../../images/2009/03/desktopthefish2.jpg" title="desktop-the-fish" /></p>
<p>I was trying to look for something to do. Searched DC++ for some games
to play, didn’t really work. Tried to watch a movie, wasn’t in the mood.
Do homework? It was a Saturday. No one does homework on Saturday.</p>
<p>Then I thought, I kinda want to learn Blender and 3D modeling and
texturing. You know, do some animation and game programming. If I wanted
to do animation, I’d have to learn some video editing. And for game
programming, I’d have to learn DirectX programming and more C++. So, I
ended up making a list of stuff I wanted to learn.</p>
<h2>The List</h2>
<ul>
<li>DirectX</li>
<li>Advanced Game Programming</li>
<li>More C++</li>
<li>Blender/3D Modeling/Textures</li>
<li>Basic Animation</li>
<li>Basic Video Editing</li>
<li>iPhone App Development</li>
<li>Android Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah that’s a lot of stuff but it’ll give me something to do if I ever
fall into “help I’m bored out of my mind” state again. If it ever does
happen I can just refer to the list and google up some tutorials.</p>
<p>I tried to start learning Blender but Windows 7 had some problems with
it and I didn’t feel like booting up the Vista partition. So I just
spent the rest of the day doing nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah I know. I’m lazy. I should probably actually try to accomplish
stuff on the list instead of just making one for fun but you know what?
Screw you. Just keeeeding. Haha.</p>
<p>I think I’ll start with DirectX/Game/C++.</p>

		<h1><a href="../../../post/spiralling-by-keane/">Spiralling by Keane</a></h1>
		<p>14 February 2009</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I’ve got the song Spiralling by Keane stuck in my head. I don’t know
why. It’s not even that great of a song but it is pretty catchy. Doesn’t
really sound like Keane’s usual stuff but whatever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OOOOO<br />
We’re tumbling down<br />
We’re spiralling<br />
OOOOO<br />
Tied up to the ground<br />
We’re spiralling</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t have any idea about what the song is about. Probably something
along the lines of a relationship falling apart or something like that.</p>

		<p>I couldn’t sleep so I spent the whole night looking through reddit.com.</p>
<p>Some interesting stuff going on.</p>
<p>Okay maybe not.</p>
<p>School is starting up soon. That sucks.</p>
<p>I really don’t want to go back to school.</p>
<p>I think medicine, doctors, technology and all that stuff are limiting
the rate that humans are evolving. That is if evolution works.</p>
<p>Why is my iPhone so slow?</p>
<p>If I go to sleep, I don’t want to wake up. If I stay awake, I don’t want
to sleep.</p>
<p>Sunflower seeds are pretty good.</p>
<p>The street lights on my block turn off at about 6:52 am. This picture
was taken at 6:39.</p>
<p><a href="../../../images/2009/01/012209sunrise.jpg"><img alt="012209

<p>That’s not the sun.</p>
<p>There was this dude on the train the other day. He was arguing with the
other dudes about how his girlfriend wasn’t let on some bus. I think he
was drunk. It was interesting.</p>
<p>I stay up really late sometimes. I like it cause everyone else is
sleeping.</p>
<p>Do not litter.</p>
<p>I usually sleep around 6. But its been taking me a lot longer to fall
asleep lately. I don’t know why.</p>
<p>These sunflower seeds taste funny.</p>
<p>Actually I do know why. But I’m not telling you.</p>
<p>I like it when I stay up really late and I get really tired. So tired
that my eyes wont stay open. I like going to sleep during that time.</p>
<p>Hey look, Chloe is sleeping.</p>
<p><a href="../../../images/2009/01/chloesleeping.jpg"><img alt="chloe
sleeping" src="../../../images/2009/01/chloesleeping-thumb.jpg" title="chloe sleeping" /></a></p>
<p>She’s gotten bigger.</p>
<p>I miss my watch.</p>
<p>Oh and about the Windows 7 on my laptop post that I said I was gonna do.
I’m not gonna do it cause I don’t care and you don’t care. Maybe you do
care but I don’t care that you care. So stop caring.</p>
<p>jQuery’s slideDown function is pissing me off. WORK.</p>
<p>“Then why do we die?” –awesome kid</p>
<p>I think I’ll go to sleep now. Maybe.</p>

		<p>Guys! Check out <a href="http://wtfoodge.com">http://wtfoodge.com</a>! It’s the latest project that I’ve
been working on with Joel and Tamer. I guess its up now and Joel has
started posting. I don’t think I’ll be posting that often.</p>
<p>I spent a couple days working on it. I wanted to learn some more stuff
about webdesign like php and css. And I did. Also learned how to write
wordpress plugins. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Overall, I think the site looks pretty good. Although there is one thing
I feel that is kinda off and that is the right column. I don’t know if
its the colors or the picture. It just looks WEIRD. Maybe its cause that
shade of grey is too dull. I don’t know.</p>
<p>So guys, give me some critiques on the design of the site. Doesn’t
matter if its something bad, I just want to know what I can do to make
it better. Web design is fun.</p>
<p>And go check it out right now. <a href="http://wtfoodge.com">http://wtfoodge.com</a></p>
<p>One last thing. Internet Explorer freaking sucks. SUCKS.</p>

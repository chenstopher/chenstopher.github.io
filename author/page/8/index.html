<p>I was watching VH1’s Top 40 Most Softsational Soft-Rock Songs the other
day and came across this song again. I just want to say that this is the
greatest song in the universe and Michael Bolton has the most intense
voice in the universe.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing a bunch of tennis these past few months using some
Volkl DNX 9 racquets that my dad bought. They’re fine but the handle was
too small for me and I thought it’d be cool to try out a new racquet so
I bought one. The Babolat AeroPro Drive to be exact.</p>
<p>This is actually the older model of the new AeroPro Drive Cortex. Rather
than paying \$185 for the newer version, I settled for the older one for
\$125 from <a href="http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpageRCBAB-BAPD.html">Tennis
Warehouse</a> and
had it strung with Prince Synthetic Gut Duraflex 16 gauge. I’m kind of a
noob at tennis so I did some research making sure the reviews were
awesome before I bought ‘em.</p>
<p>It arrived earlier today (8/6/09) and went out to play with it with
Georo, the same guy that is in <a href="http://www.chenstopher.com/snowboard-08/">my shitty snowboarding
videos</a>, and who also got a
new racquet today. Anyway, the AeroPro Drive is nice. The larger handle
is definitely better. It feels stiffer than the DNX 9’s I was using, not
sure if that’s good or bad. Ok, I’ll shut up now and put some more
pictures up.</p>

<p>I just got a new set of headphones to replace the ones I broke <a href="http://www.chenstopher.com/birthday-20/" title="Birthday #20">the
other day</a>.
They’re the Audio Technica ATH-AD700’s and they are awesome. They look a
little weird with the purple/pink colored metal sides but they’re light,
comfortable, and sound great.</p>

		<p>Hey look its my birthday. Guess what I did today (so far).</p>
<p>First I broke my HD280 headphones. They cost me \$80.</p>
<p>Then I removed a microphone from one headset and soldered it onto
another headset.</p>
<p>I bet you’re wondering why it says birthday #20 when I’m only 19. Ok,
you’re probably not wondering but I’ll tell you anyway.</p>
<p>Actually, I won’t tell you cause its obvious and if you can’t figure it
out, too bad.</p>
<p>Btw, never ever order the Steakhouse burger from Burger King. It’s
terrible.</p>

		<p>09 June 2009</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Sometimes I wish my name wasn’t Christopher Chen. It’s almost like the
combination of the two most popular names ever. I mean think of all the
Chris’ and Christophers you know and then think of all the Chens you
know. It’s a lot.</p>
<p>The main reason why I wish my name was a little more unique is so that I
can buy a domain name with my full name in it. When you see some dude’s
website url is like… dannychoo.com, you think to yourself, “Damn man,
this dude is the legit shit”. Then you go onto godaddy and check if your
name domain name is already taken. Turns out it is. And by some random
<a href="http://christopherchen.com/">asian american actor</a>.</p>
<p>Then you start thinking of derivatives of your name domain name.
chrischen.com, chris.chen.com, chrischen.net, christopherchen.net,
cchen.com, chenchris.com. But then you realize its just not the same and
there’s nothing you can do about it so you settle for chenstopher.com.</p>
<p>Another reason is that when I google my name, I don’t find me. I find a
shit load of random-ass doctors.</p>
<p>Whatever. I don’t really feeling like listing more reasons. At least it
isn’t, say, Hannan Butt. Just keeeeedddinggg.</p>

		<p>After installing the new RAM sticks and hard drive, I had to reinstall
OS X onto the new hard drive and set up the rest of my new MacBook.
Windows 7 on a separate partition was a must so I installed that too.</p>

<p>My mom wanted my old <a href="http://store.shopfujitsu.com/fpc/Ecommerce/buildseriesbean.do?series=T4220">Fujitsu

so she offered to get me another laptop for it. I took it. I’ve been
wanting to try out Mac OS X and get into iPhone development. So I ended
up ordering a MacBook ‘cause those things are only available on Macs,
well at least legally.</p>

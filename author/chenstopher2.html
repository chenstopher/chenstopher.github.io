		<p><a href="../images/2012/03/mockup.png"><img alt="Builder mockup" src="../images/2012/03/mockup-570x427.png" title="mockup" /></a></p>
<p>Here is an unfinished mockup of a game I started making. The concept was
pretty much tetris but you don't control the tetrominoes directly. You
control a little construction robot worker that can catch, carry, and
throw them. There would be a evil dude in the crane that would be
dropping pieces to mess you up.</p>
<p>I started working on the game a few week ago. Currently, the player can
run around, jump, pick up pieces, and throw pieces. It's not really in a
playable state and I don't think I'm going to continue working on it.
After implementing those basic player mechanics, I realized it wasn't
that much fun. So I'm scraping it.</p>
<p>For me, the actual purpose of the project was to learn how to implement
and use a entity-component system. It's a system where game entities are
made up of different components (health, position, spatial) rather than
being subclasses of a parent entity. I got that part of the game working
so I guess it was worth working on.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll pick this up again at a later time. Probably not.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124052/">City of Life and Death</a>, a film
about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre">Nanjing
Massacre</a>.</p>
<p>This movie is disturbing.  I don't even know how any one could do such
horrific things to another human being. What makes this even more
disturbing is that the events depicted in the movie do not even compare
to what actually happened during the massacre.</p>
<p>Seriously. Watch this movie. Then go look up Nanjing Massacre on
Wikipedia.</p>

		<p>04 February 2012</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Went movie hopping today and saw four movies.</p>
<p>The first movie was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/">Chronicle</a>.
This one was unexpectedly good. I was going into this thinking that it
would be another crappy teens with super power movie (see Jumper) but
man was I surprised.</p>
<p>Then I went over to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596365/">The Woman in
Black</a>. It was a solid ghost story
but had your typical horror movie scare tactics. I liked it though. The
only thing that slightly bothered me was Daniel Radcliffe's role as a
father. I couldn't help thinking, "THIS GUY IS HARRY POTTER DAMN IT."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1601913/">The Grey</a> was the third one and
definitely my favorite out of the ones I watched today. Just a great
story about survival and the toll it takes on human beings. It reminded
me a lot of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106246/">Alive</a>, a similar
movie that I liked. It was even referenced by one of the characters in
The Grey.</p>
<p>Watched<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229238/">Mission Impossible: Ghost
Protocol</a> last. I missed the first
couple minutes cause I  was waiting for the after credits scene for The
Grey. I don't usually like action movies like these, but it was
entertaining. Good action scenes, awesome gadgets, and a bit of humor
here and there.</p>
<p>I think I could've did one more but there was nothing good to watch and
I was tired of eating gummy bears and Milk Duds.</p>
<p>Note to future Chris: Do this again.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I went snowboarding at <a href="http://windhammountain.com" title="Windham Mountain">Windham
Mountain</a> for a couple of
days during Christmas. There wasn't much snowfall this year so not many
of the trails were open but it was better that I expected. They have
this waffle house thing near the base of the hill so every time you get
on the lift you smelled awesomeness. I thought that was pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Finally learned how to ride switch. The trick is toe-side turns =
squeeze your knees together, heel-side turns = push your knees apart.</p>

<p>I brought my Drift camera with me and a got a bunch of videos. The one
above is from one of the night sessions runs. It's my favorite video
cause Georo falls a lot in it. And by a lot I mean every time he tries
to do a jump.</p>

		<p>Last time I tried to learn dvorak, it was a complete failure. I was
typing way too slow and I had work to complete so I just gave up on it.
I've decided to try and learn it again mainly because I was completely
bored out of my mind but also cause I've been starting to feel some pain
in my fingers. Dvorak is supposed to be "healthier" for your fingers or
something cause you don't have to move your fingers as much.</p>
<p>I already had my desktop keyboard switched to dvorak. I wanted to
seriously learn it this time so I even converted my Macbook's keys to
dvorak. Wasn't too hard. Just popped them off with a tiny screw driver
and put them back in the correct order. Now people who want to use my
computer won't be able to because all the keys are in the wrong places.
Awesome!</p>

<p>I've been playing typeracer everyday since I've switched over to speed
up my typing. Right now I'm typing at around 40 wpm (vs 80wpm when I was
using qwerty) which isn't too bad considering I've only been using
dvorak for four days. But I feel like a noob cause I have to keep
looking at the keys. The most annoying thing about dvorak is that all
the shortcut keys are now on the other side of the keyboard. Ctrl-c,
ctrl-v, ctrl-s, ctrl-z are all on the right side. Also I keep typing
"ass" when I want to type "all" because the 's' is now where the 'l'
used to be. Kind of annoying</p>
<p>That's all for now. Off to play some more typeracer. I'll revisit this
when my typing speed reaches 100+ wpm.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>A couple days ago, I went to the
<a href="http://www.campusdining.org/location-union-commons?PHPSESSID=3793723da705a07bf83ca0fad2a01fd3">Union</a>
to get some food with people. I went in and grabbed CJ's Chicken Tenders
and a cream soda and sat down to eat. I start eating the chicken tenders
one by one not really paying attention to what they looked like.
Finally, I got to the last one and noticed something strange about it.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like a PENIS!</strong></p>

<a href="../../images/2008/11/img-02601.jpg"><img alt="IMG_0260" src="../../images/2008/11/img-0260-thumb1.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I thought It would be funny to put
<a href="http://qtjoel.com/2008/10/14/jason-tutoring/">Jason</a> on it. Just look
at his face! What a douche.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2008/11/chicken-tender-5.jpg"><img alt="Chicken Tender
(5)" src="../../images/2008/11/chicken-tender-5-thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I still haven't eaten the penis-shaped chicken tender 'cause it seems
kind of awkward. It stuck it in the fridge and now its just sitting
there. Maybe someday someone will open it and eat it, not paying
attention to the shape of it, and we'll all laugh at him. Penis-eater.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I woke up on Saturday around 3 o' clock in the afternoon and walked
downstairs to get some food. Then suddenly Clifford (my younger brother,
not actually the Big Red Dog) walks in with a box. I go, "WTF is that?"
He says, "It's a puppy!"</p>
<p>So here's Chloe.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2008/11/snv32275.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/snv32275-150x150.jpg" title="snv32275" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/snv32274.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/snv32274-150x150.jpg" title="snv32274" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/snv32269.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/snv32269-150x150.jpg" title="snv32269" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/snv32268.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/snv32268-150x150.jpg" title="snv32268" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/snv32264.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/snv32264-150x150.jpg" title="snv32264" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/snv32261.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/snv32261-150x150.jpg" title="snv32261" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/snv32258.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/snv32258-150x150.jpg" title="snv32258" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/snv32256.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/snv32256-150x150.jpg" title="snv32256" /></a></p>
<p>And a video:</p>
<p align="center">
<embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2144103&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=0bc4d9&amp;fullscreen=1" width="470" height="354" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always">
</embed>
</p>

<p>I don't know how Cliff got my mom to get the dog. My mom used to always
complain about how they're such a hassle. They shed, shit and piss
everywhere. But I guess its kind of cool having one around.</p>

		<h1><a href="../../post/messenger-bags-are-pretty-cool/">Messenger Bags are Pretty Cool</a></h1>
		<p>01 November 2008</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p><a href="../../images/2008/11/canvas_bag.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/canvas_bag-150x150.jpg" title="canvas_bag" /></a>So
here's my old messenger bag. I found it on dell.com and thought it was
the coolest messenger bag in the world. It was cheap, had some awesome
tattoo-like thing on it, and some super innovative closing mechanism. So
I ordered it and it came. Shit, I was wrong. It was a bigger than I had
expected. The tattoo-like thing looked kinda ghey. And the innovative
closing mechanism took for-freaking-ever to close! If I packed it with
my laptop and other things, it got really heavy and my shoulder would
hurt cause there is no padding on the strap. But whatever, I didn't feel
like getting another one so I dealt with that crap for a couple months.</p>
<p>Then I found <a href="http://www.chromebags.com">Chrome</a> bags. Man, they are so
awesome. They look pretty awesome and they have this super cool seatbelt
strap thing. I did some research and found out they are pretty much
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwNlBfLix4">indestructible.</a> One thing
I was worried about was size cause all the pics on the site made the bag
look HUGE. But whatever, I ordered it anyway. I got the smallest size,
cause I didn't want it to be too big.</p>
<p>After about a week it came. And here it is. Looks pretty awesome. Got
the Red/black stripe one cause red is awesome and so is black. Check out
that SUPER COOL seatbelt buckle! The strap is also really comfortable
and easily adjustable.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2008/11/chrome_1.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/chrome_1-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_1" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/chrome_2_strap.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/chrome_2_strap-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_2_strap" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/chrome_3_buckle.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/chrome_3_buckle-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_3_buckle" /></a></p>
<p>One problem though. ITS TOO FREAKING SMALL! I put my laptop, laptop
charger, a couple magazines and a chemistry workbook from sophomore year
of high school that I found in the bag and it barely fit. The bag looks
like its gonna explode.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2008/11/chrome_4_inside.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/chrome_4_inside-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_4_inside" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/chrome_5_explode.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/chrome_5_explode-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_5_explode" /></a><a href="../../images/2008/11/chrome_6_explode.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/2008/11/chrome_6_explode-150x150.jpg" title="chrome_6_explode" /></a></p>
<p>I emailed Chrome. I'm gonna exchange it for the next size up. Hopefully
it will be the right size. Shipping is expensive!</p>
<p>I hate it when I get hyped up for something I ordered online and when it
finally gets here it turns out not how I expected. Sigh.</p>

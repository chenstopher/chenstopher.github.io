		<p>Well, what is there to say? It’s the new year and it’ll probably be the
same as the last year.</p>
<p>I don’t really have any new year resolutions cause I don’t believe in
them. No one ever sticks to them and I bet you probably couldn’t even
remember the resolutions you set last year.</p>
<p>Now we’re all gonna get messed up when we have to write the date cause
we’re used to writing 2008. Now we have to get used to this new crap,
2009.</p>
<p>The new ball looks pretty cool though. Lots of pretty lights.</p>
<p>I think I’ll change my wordpress theme.</p>
<p>Hey, we’re one year closer to the end of the world.</p>
<p>Australia got their new year 16 hours ago. I think. And its like summer
there. Weird.</p>
<p>LEAP SECOND! Cause the earth isn’t spinning fast enough.</p>

now. I think.</p>

		<p>We finally got to go snowboarding even though the trip was nearly
cancelled. It was a four day trip to
<a href="http://www.belleayre.com">Belleayre</a>, a small but fun mountain. The
conditions ranged from wet slushy snow to man-made snow over ice and
super fog to bright sunshine. The ice sucked but it was pretty good
overall. I finally learned to ride switch which is awesome. And this is
how it went down.</p>

		<p>It’s snowing! Although it isn’t the first time this season its still
pretty awesome. Weather.com says its gonna be about 4-6 inches of snow
around campus.</p>
<p>I hope there’s like 100 times more snow up on the mountains. I want to
ride some snow up there not some stupid ice we’re known for on the ICE
COAST. I’m extra excited to go this season. I don’t really know why. I
guess cause college has been a crap load of work and snowboarding is
such a great way to just chill.</p>
<p>Freaking Chem final, why are you on the 22nd?</p>

		<p>I haven't played my guitar in quite a while. I don't know what happened,
I just kind of lost interest in it. Sometimes I pick it up and play some
stuff but otherwise it just sits in the corner of my room collecting
dust.</p>

	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I think <a href="http://tokyoflash.com">Tokyoflash</a> has the coolest watches
ever. They're kinda high-tech and futuristic-looking and imported from
JAPAN! We all know Japan makes the coolest shit.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2008/12/oberon.jpg"><img alt="oberon" src="../../images/2008/12/oberon-thumb.jpg" /></a>
The watch on the right is called the S-Mode Oberon. It's the one I got
after I broke my G-shock watch. The outer ring is hours, inner most ring
is tens digit of the minutes, and the one in the middle is the ones
digit. When I first got it, it took forever to figure out what time it
was but then I got used to it. Its cool because other people can't tell
what time it is. It's probably the coolest watch I ever had minus this
Power Rangers watch I had when I was little.</p>
<p>Check it out in action (skip to 2:30):</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"

                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>But I broke the strap it some freak freebording accident and I still
haven't gotten it fixed. I'll probably get it fixed over the winter
break(SNOWBOARD 08!!!!!!) or maybe I'll just give it to my brother as a
present. I want to get another one but they're so freaking expensive.</p>
<p>I hate not having a watch and not knowing what time it is.</p>

		<h1><a href="../../post/things-i-hate-reading/">Things I Hate: Reading</a></h1>
		<p>01 December 2008</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I hate reading. I don't find it interesting at all. And I don't get how
people can just sit down and read a entire book. I think it's the most
boring crap ever. I would rather sit around and do nothing than read a
book. That's how much it sucks.</p>
<p>I do this weird thing when I read. I'll be reading and then I'll start
thinking about something random word I read in the book. Then I'll stop
daydreaming and I'll be a page ahead from where I started daydreaming.
It's like I can daydream and read at the same time but I won't remember
anything that I read.</p>
<p>If they were subtitles to a movie I was watching, then I have no problem
reading that. But whenever I see pages and pages of huge blocks of text
and no pictures, I freaking hate it. I think its kind of like waiting in
a huge ass line for absolutely... NOTHING!</p>
<p>So yeah, sorry for making you read.</p>

		<p>11 November 2008</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Qwop is this dude that comes from a country whose training program was
under-funded and now has to run in the Olympics. What you do in the game
is try to run 100 meters using the Q, W, O and P keys without falling
over. Q and W control the thighs and O and P control the calves.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html"><img alt="qwop" src="../../images/2008/11/qwop.jpg" /></a><br />
Click the image to play</em></p>
<p>I found this on <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2008/11/browser_game_pick_qwop_olympic.html">Indie
Games</a>.
It's probably one of the stupidest games I've ever played but I have no
idea why its so addicting. When you first play the game, it seems
impossible to run but then you get the hang of it and it's kind of
satisfying. Its hilarious when Qwop falls cause he looks so freaking
dumb. My best is 53.2m by actually running. Not that stupid crawling
crap.</p>

		<p>09 November 2008</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>A couple days ago, I went to the
<a href="http://www.campusdining.org/location-union-commons?PHPSESSID=3793723da705a07bf83ca0fad2a01fd3">Union</a>
to get some food with people. I went in and grabbed CJ's Chicken Tenders
and a cream soda and sat down to eat. I start eating the chicken tenders
one by one not really paying attention to what they looked like.
Finally, I got to the last one and noticed something strange about it.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2008/11/chicken-tender-21.jpg"><img alt="Chicken Tender

<p><strong>It looks like a PENIS!</strong></p>

<a href="../../images/2008/11/img-02601.jpg"><img alt="IMG_0260" src="../../images/2008/11/img-0260-thumb1.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I thought It would be funny to put
<a href="http://qtjoel.com/2008/10/14/jason-tutoring/">Jason</a> on it. Just look
at his face! What a douche.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2008/11/chicken-tender-5.jpg"><img alt="Chicken Tender
(5)" src="../../images/2008/11/chicken-tender-5-thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I still haven't eaten the penis-shaped chicken tender 'cause it seems
kind of awkward. It stuck it in the fridge and now its just sitting
there. Maybe someday someone will open it and eat it, not paying
attention to the shape of it, and we'll all laugh at him. Penis-eater.</p>

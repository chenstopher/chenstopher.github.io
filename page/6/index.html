		<p>It is dumping snow outside.</p>
<p>I tried to build a snow fort today but I got bored after building one
wall.</p>
<p>Then Cliff decided to turn the stairs leading out the the backyard into
a ramp so he could snowboard off it, and he did.</p>
<p>Then he got tired and I buried him in snow and Chloe (our dog) almost
peed on him.</p>
<p>Finally, we went back inside and I tried to find a good movie to instant
watch on Netflix but I realized I’ve seen all of good ones already.</p>
<p>These seem like good captions for photos. Unfortunately, I don’t take
any.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for Wednesday.</p>

		<h1><a href="../../post/another-keyboard/">Another Keyboard</a></h1>
		<p>26 November 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I told myself I wasn’t going to buy anything but Steam games this Black
Friday but I couldn’t resist. <a href="http://www.thehumansolution.com/kinesis-advantage.html">The Human
Solution</a> was
having a sale on the <a href="http://kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm">Kinesis
Advantage</a> (a \$300 dollar
keyboard) with a 10% off coupon for Black Friday and free shipping. FREE
SHIPPING!</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2010/11/kinesis_advantage.jpg"><img alt="kinesis_advantage" src="../../images/2010/11/kinesis_advantage_thumb.jpg" title="kinesis_advantage" /></a></p>
<p>Yep, I just bought this keyboard for \$242.10, shipped.</p>
<p>Now let me explain. My RSI/carpal-tunnel symptoms have been getting
worse and worse so I’ve been looking for some ergonomic keyboards to
help fix it. There is quite a selection of them but I wanted one with
mechanical switches leaving only a few (expensive) choices. Among them
was the the Kinesis Advantage, one of the highest-regarded ergonomic
keyboards. The huge price tag had put me off initially but then I
thought about it for a bit. Here’s the rationale I came up with to
convince myself into buying it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m probably going to be making a living typing on a keyboard, might
    as well make it a nice one and not ruin my hands.</li>
<li>I’m hoping this will help with the RSI/carpal-tunnel problems.
    Better get a ergonomic keyboard than have to go to doctor to treat
    them, right?</li>
<li>It’ll make me type faster and be more productive (hopefully).</li>
<li>It’ll look super cool!</li>
<li>\$242.10 is still not that expensive for a keyboard is it? I feel
    like keyboards are often the most neglected piece of computer
    hardware and most people buy the cheapest one they can find. As a
    person who uses the computer for the majority of the day, the
    keyboard is one of the most important pieces of a system. It’s how
    you interact with your computer, how you control it (yeah, yeah,
    there’s the mouse too). It should be on par with the other
    components of your system.</li>
<li>IT’S 19.3% OFF!</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one was what really convinced me to buy it. Can’t mess with
the percentages man.</p>
<p>I will probably put up a review when I get it. I’m excited; I love
getting stuff in the mail.</p>

		<p>Wouldn’t it be interesting if hair grew up to a certain length and then
stopped? Imagine how our lives would be different. Would social status
would be based on the length of your hair? Would barbers exist? Would we
now have a new form of prejudice called hairism? What kind of
interesting hair products would be created from this? Would the average
male hair length be shorter or longer than female hair length?</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I dropped my polyphasic sleep schedule.  I got through three weeks of
the Everyman schedule but it wasn’t working out cause I was over
sleeping too much.</p>
<p>On the last day, I went to take a 20 minute nap and woke up 19 hours
later.</p>
<p>So yeah. It’s back to the monophasic schedule for now. However, I plan
on trying a polyphasic schedule again sometime in the future. Maybe with
a partner so we can keep each other awake.</p>

		<h1><a href="../../post/everyman-sleep-schedule-week-one/">Everyman Sleep Schedule: Week One</a></h1>
		<p>26 October 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Surprisingly, the first day on the everyman schedule wasn’t so bad. I
followed the schedule pretty tightly. I always slept and woke when I
should’ve and everything went to plan. I did, however, expect to be way
more tired than I actually was. I never found myself falling asleep
during the day or having the urge to lie on my bed and just sleep for
the rest of the day. Overall, I’d say the first day went well.</p>
<p>The second day, however, was pretty horrible. I didn’t really have
anything to do till 13:00 after waking up at a 7:00 so was completely
bored out of my mind and drifting into zombie mode. I was so tired and
all I wanted to do was sleep. But I didn’t want to give up so I just
played a couple levels of Trine.</p>
<p>I overslept on a 20 minute nap on day three and another 20 minute nap on
day four because my alarm didn’t ring. However, I was still able to
follow the schedule as normal and didn’t have trouble sleeping though
I’m becoming paranoid of my alarm trying to sabotage my sleep schedule.</p>
<p>I overslept again on day five. This time it was the 3 hour core nap. I
think the alarm went off on time and I shut it off and went back to
sleep but I can’t say that I remember. I ended up waking up right before
when my first nap should start so I just slept for another 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Day six was a disaster. It was a Sunday and I decided to go catch the
matinee showing of the Social Network (good movie, by the way). It was
at 11:20 and ended around 14:00 so I missed my 12:XX nap. Walked around
with a couple of friends till 18:00 where I took a nap on the train.
Then I took my 23:XX nap and over slept one hour. Missing my first nap
was terrible.</p>
<p>And the last day went pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a pretty interesting week. The entire week I felt like a
zombie. You know when you pull an all nighter and you get to that time
of day where you are know you haven’t slept but don’t really feel tired
and everything feels like a dream? That’s what it felt like for me
except for the entire day.</p>
<p>For some reason, waking up from the 3 hour nap felt worse than the 20
minute ones. After waking from a 20 minute nap, I feel really refreshed
and any sleepiness I had before going into it is mostly gone. The
post-3-hour-nap, however, is Getting past the time after waking up from
the 3 hour nap is the hardest part. That 7:00 to 9:50/12:50 period is
just complete zombie mode. Like a zombie that just got shot with a
tranquilizer gun. A little caffeine helps me get through it, but it’s
still difficult.</p>
<p>I still more tired than using a monophasic sleep schedule but I’m hoping
to get used to the Everyman by the second week.</p>

		<h1><a href="../../post/polyphasic-sleep-schedule/">Polyphasic Sleep Schedule</a></h1>
		<p>18 October 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I’m planning on starting my polyphasic sleep schedule experiment thingy
today. If you’re unfamiliar with what that is then read up on it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">the
wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, rather than sleeping once a day for around 8 hours, I’ll be
breaking up my sleeping into multiple periods. There is less total sleep
time but more REM sleep time (theoretically). The most common polyphasic
sleep schedule is called the Uberman Sleep Schedule which breaks up your
sleep into twenty minute naps every four hours. I thought was way too
hardcore so I decided on the easier route, the <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Everyman+Sleep+Schedule">Everyman Sleep
Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>The Everyman Sleep Schedule is one three hour core “nap”, followed by
three twenty minute naps spread about five hours apart. There’s a bunch
of info on it
<a href="http://everything2.com/title/Everyman+Sleep+Schedule">here</a>, if you are
interested. I have it all planned out on Google calendar. Sleep from
4:00 – 7:00, 20 minute naps at 12:20, 18:55, and 23:20. Because of my
class schedule I won’t have exactly five hour gaps between each of my
naps but whatever.</p>
<p>What I’m planning to get out of this is more time to work on homework
and projects as well as feeling more rested. Yes, believe it or not,
this schedule is supposed to make you feel less tired and have more
energy. Not sure if this is true or not, but I guess we’ll find out
soon.</p>

you can get double the amount of referral storage. Instead of 250mb per

<p>I implemented the A* pathfinding algorithm in python/pygame today. Yep.
I was bored of doing Source SDK stuff for my CSE381 class and so I
decided to learn a new language, framework, and algorithm. The program
itself is pretty basic and isn't really that optimized but it
works. Maybe I'll post the executable once I figure out how to build
python code into exes.</p>
<p>I'm actually really liking python/pygame. Maybe I'll make my next game
with it.</p>

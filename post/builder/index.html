<p>Here is an unfinished mockup of a game I started making. The concept was
pretty much tetris but you don't control the tetrominoes directly. You
control a little construction robot worker that can catch, carry, and
throw them. There would be a evil dude in the crane that would be
dropping pieces to mess you up.</p>
<p>I started working on the game a few week ago. Currently, the player can
run around, jump, pick up pieces, and throw pieces. It's not really in a
playable state and I don't think I'm going to continue working on it.
After implementing those basic player mechanics, I realized it wasn't
that much fun. So I'm scraping it.</p>
<p>For me, the actual purpose of the project was to learn how to implement
and use a entity-component system. It's a system where game entities are
made up of different components (health, position, spatial) rather than
being subclasses of a parent entity. I got that part of the game working
so I guess it was worth working on.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll pick this up again at a later time. Probably not.</p>

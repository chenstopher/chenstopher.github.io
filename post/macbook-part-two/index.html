		<p>After installing the new RAM sticks and hard drive, I had to reinstall
OS X onto the new hard drive and set up the rest of my new MacBook.
Windows 7 on a separate partition was a must so I installed that too.</p>


<h3>Installing Leopard</h3>
<p><a href="../../images/2009/04/installingleopard1.jpg"><img alt="installing-leopard" src="../../images/2009/04/installingleopard-thumb1.jpg" title="installing-leopard" /></a>
<a href="../../images/2009/04/installingleopard21.jpg"><img alt="installing-leopard-2" src="../../images/2009/04/installingleopard2-thumb1.jpg" title="installing-leopard-2" /></a></p>
<p>First I popped the installation disk in and it automatically booted from
cd drive. I don’t really remember all the steps but it was really easy.
I got stuck on one part with the formatting options. I was used to the
NTFS and FAT stuff that windows uses. The Mac installer has like a bunch
of different options that I had no idea about. There was Mac OS
Extended, Mac OS Extended(Journaled), Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive),
and Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive Journaled).</p>
<p>Found the answer after some googling. Mac OS Extended is HFS+. A
Journaled partition does some magic to make it more fault-tolerant or
something like that. Case-sensitive makes file and folder names well,
case-sensitive (“filename.txt” != “fileName.txt”). And Case-sensitive,
Journaled is a combo of both.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2009/04/installingleopard31.jpg"><img alt="installing-leopard-3" src="../../images/2009/04/installingleopard3-thumb1.jpg" title="installing-leopard-3" /></a>
<a href="../../images/2009/04/installingapps1.jpg"><img alt="installing-apps" src="../../images/2009/04/installingapps-thumb1.jpg" title="installing-apps" /></a></p>
<p>I picked the default one, Mac OS Extended Journaled and continued with
the install. Installation finished in about 30 minutes or so. I was
surprised that there wasn’t any serial number thing or activation. But
then again, Apple doesn’t really make money from software stuff. Then
came the super cool welcome screen.</p>
<p>Set up my account info. After that, I put in the applications disc and
installed all that crap (Garageband, iPhoto, iMovie).</p>
<h3>BOOT CAMP BITCHES</h3>
<p>And then came Boot Camp. Ran the Boot Camp Assistant and partitioned the
drives for about half OSX, half Win7. But oh noooo I have no DVDs for
Windows 7! I spent an hour trying to figure out how to install Windows 7
to the Boot Camp partition using a USB drive or something. No dice. I
just went to sleep and waited till tomorrow to get some blank DVDs at
the bookstore.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2009/04/dvdr1.jpg"><img alt="dvd-r" src="../../images/2009/04/dvdr-thumb1.jpg" title="dvd-r" /></a></p>
<p>I went to the bookstore the next day and bought a 2 pack of blank DVDs.
IT WAS FREAKING 5 BUCKS FOR TWO DVD-R DISCS. Shit. So expensive. Stony
Brook sure knows how to rip students off.</p>
<h3>Windows 7?</h3>
<p><a href="../../images/2009/04/windows71.jpg"><img alt="windows-7" src="../../images/2009/04/windows7-thumb1.jpg" title="windows-7" /></a></p>
<p>Burned the win7.iso to the dvd and installed it through Boot Camp. Win7
install was an easy process, as usual. But when it finished installing
and booted to Win7, the cd wouldn’t eject! I kept pressing the stupid
eject button on the keyboard over and over again and that crap wouldn’t
eject. So I had to restart, boot into Mac OS X, eject the cd from there,
put in the Mac install disc and boot back into Win7. Mad annoying. And
the Boot Camp driver auto-install thing wouldn’t work at first so I had
to find the right install file in the CD.</p>
<h3>Zombie Killing Fun</h3>
<p><a href="../../images/2009/04/snv337361.jpg"><img alt="SNV33736" src="../../images/2009/04/snv33736-thumb1.jpg" title="SNV33736" /></a>

<p>After the driver stuff finished, I immediately installed Steam and L4D
to see if that crap worked. I didn’t get the MacBook for gaming but I
was wondering how the 9400m would hold up. The L4D installation took
FOREVER. It would keep disconnecting and reconnecting. Stupid Stonybrook
resnet bullshit. They need to get it fixed. After about an hour or two
or three.</p>
<p>L4D finally finished installing. Ran it, played a little single player.
Works perfect. Well, I had to dial down the graphics a little to medium
but it does work. Sweet. Another L4D gaming machine.</p>
<h3>Next next post</h3>
<p>This is getting kinda long and boring so I think I’ll split it into
multiple posts. Next time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parallels &amp; VMWare</li>
<li>Why doesnt OS X allow me to customize multitouch gestures</li>
<li>I don’t like this keyboard</li>
<li>Glossy screen is a fingerprint + glare magnet</li>
<li>Spaces + Expose + Quicksilver + Screen Corners = \&lt;3</li>
<li>This trackpad isn’t that great</li>
<li>and more sheet.</li>
</ul>

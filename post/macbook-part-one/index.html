		<p>So I got a MacBook.</p>
<p>My mom wanted my old <a href="http://store.shopfujitsu.com/fpc/Ecommerce/buildseriesbean.do?series=T4220">Fujitsu
tablet</a>
so she offered to get me another laptop for it. I took it. I’ve been
wanting to try out Mac OS X and get into iPhone development. So I ended
up ordering a MacBook ‘cause those things are only available on Macs,
well at least legally.</p>


<h3>Its Refurbished</h3>
<p>I got a <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac">refurbished
MacBook</a>.
2.4GHz, 2GB, 250GB. Yeah, it’s used but most of the MacBooks that are
refurbished were probably returned for minor cosmetic defects. Those
returned Macs go through Apples refurbishing process where the computer
is fixed up and tested. Anything that’s wrong with it gets replaced so
it’s almost like getting a brand new computer. Plus it was \$250 dollars
cheaper than with the education discount and \$300 cheaper than a new
one. Too bad there isn’t an education discount on refurbished Macs. That
would kick ass.</p>
<h3>The Package</h3>
<p><a href="../../images/2009/04/snv33714.jpg"><img alt="Macbook Refurbished

<a href="../../images/2009/04/snv33715.jpg"><img alt="Macbook Refurbished Box
Inside" src="../../images/2009/04/snv33715-thumb.jpg" title="Macbook Refurbished Box Inside" /></a></p>
<p>I got the package yesterday and was super excited to open it. I’ve
opened up a MacBook package before and I’ve gotta say, the refurbished
one is much less epic. It comes in a larger, uglier, white box and just
lacks the niceness of a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/macbook-unboxing/">new MacBook
package</a>. Inside is a
long box with only the words “Apple Certified” written on it that
contains the discs, papers, power brick, and cables.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2009/04/snv33716.jpg"><img alt="MacBook

<a href="../../images/2009/04/snv33745.jpg"><img alt="MacBook

<a href="../../images/2009/04/snv33738.jpg"><img alt="MacBook" src="../../images/2009/04/snv33738-thumb.jpg" title="MacBook" /></a>
<a href="../../images/2009/04/snv33740.jpg"><img alt="MacBook
Keys" src="../../images/2009/04/snv33740-thumb.jpg" title="MacBook Keys" /></a></p>
<p>Under the box is the actual MacBook wrapped in plastic and encased in
foam inserts to protect it from shipment damage. The computer looks
brand new despite it being refurbished and all. There aren’t any
scratches or defects to be found, looks and feels really study. I booted
it up and tested that it was working okay.</p>
<p>Then turned it off.</p>
<h3>What?</h3>
<p>Here’s where the <a href="http://www.chenstopher.com/newegg-package-came-today/">Newegg
package</a> comes
in. I took the \$250 I saved and bought a 500GB hard drive and 4GB of
ram with \$100 left over. Take those parts, stick that in my refurbished
Mac and I end up with a MacBook that is cheaper and better than a brand
new one. Replacing the parts took a measly 5-10 minutes.</p>
<h3>Installing the Hard Drive</h3>
<p><a href="../../images/2009/04/snv33723.jpg"><img alt="MacBook back cover
off" src="../../images/2009/04/snv33723-thumb.jpg" title="MacBook back cover off" /></a>
<a href="../../images/2009/04/snv33719.jpg"><img alt="MacBook Hard
drive" src="../../images/2009/04/snv33719-thumb.jpg" title="MacBook Hard drive" /></a></p>
<p>Opening the latch allowed me to remove part of the back cover and gave
me access to the battery and hard drive. The picture on the left is
actually the laptop after I finished installing everything cause I
forgot to take a picture beforehand. I removed the battery by pulling
the tab attached to it. The hard drive is held by a retaining bar with a
screw. Unscrewed that, removed the hard drive, and transferred the four
Torx T6 screws and plastic tab over to the new hard drive. If you’ve
never heard of Torx T6 screws, its okay, neither have I. Luckily I had
this little screw driver kit on me that had a screw bit that fit (that’s
a lot of “it”s).</p>
<h3>Installing the Ram</h3>
<p><a href="../../images/2009/04/snv33721.jpg"><img alt="MacBook
ram1" src="../../images/2009/04/snv33721-thumb.jpg" title="MacBook ram1" /></a>
<a href="../../images/2009/04/snv33722.jpg"><img alt="MacBook ram
2" src="../../images/2009/04/snv33722-thumb.jpg" title="MacBook ram 2" /></a></p>
<p>Now for the RAM. This part was a little more annoying, lots of little
screws to deal with. There were 8 of them. After removing them, the
whole back panel comes off, exposing the internal components of the
MacBook. Fancy. The two 1GB sticks are located right above where the
battery should be and are held in by retention clips. The sticks are
easily removed. I replaced them with the two 2GB sticks that I got from
Newegg.</p>
<p>Screw the back plate back on, put the hard drive, battery, and cover
back on and it’s done.</p>
<h3>Next Post</h3>
<p>This is getting kinda long and boring so I think I’ll split it into
multiple posts. Next time:</p>
<ul>
<li>WTF is “Mac OS Extended Journaled”?</li>
<li>BOOT CAMP BITCHES</li>
<li>WTF 2 DVD-Rs for \$5!?</li>
<li>Why is my spacebar obnoxiously loud?</li>
<li>Parallels &amp; VMware</li>
<li>OS X isn’t thaaat great</li>
<li>I wonder if this can run L4D</li>
<li>and more sheet.</li>
</ul>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>We finally got to go snowboarding even though the trip was nearly
cancelled. It was a four day trip to
<a href="http://www.belleayre.com">Belleayre</a>, a small but fun mountain. The
conditions ranged from wet slushy snow to man-made snow over ice and
super fog to bright sunshine. The ice sucked but it was pretty good
overall. I finally learned to ride switch which is awesome. And this is
how it went down.</p>

<h2>Day One: Clear skies, loose granular.</h2>
<p>We left early Friday morning after staying up the previous night playing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunbound_">Gunbound</a>(we were bored, really
really bored). A lot of people went: my mom, dad, Georo, Hannan,
Quentin, Brian, Clifford, Kevin, Alpha and me. David was supposed to
come but he was a little girl and stayed home. It was gonna be a long
drive so we brought <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386064/">Tae Guk Gi</a>
with us. Ended up not watching it.There was a really nice sunrise on the
way there. Got a couple of pictures of it. It was a pretty boring ride
so the guys fell asleep.</p>
<p><a href="./images/2008/12/snv33615.jpg"><img alt="SNV33615" src="./images/2008/12/snv33615-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33615" /></a>

<p>We finally got to the mountain. The snow was okay, at least it wasn’t
ice. Hannan has never gone snowboarding so on his first time off the
chairlift, he did a face plant. It was pretty funny. I made a few runs
and then we got stuck on the lift! We must’ve been there for at least 30
minutes.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">

                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>Me and Georo did a couple runs at the upper mountain and that was the
end of day one. I was pretty tired ‘cause it’s been a while since I last
went snowboarding.</p>
<h2>Day Two: Rain and Fog, Wet Snow.</h2>
<p>The day started out kinda crappy. We woke up to rain so we decided to
wait till it stopped to go up to the mountain. The snow got all wet but
it wasn’t that bad. But the sky was FREAKING FOGGY.</p>
<p><a href="./images/2008/12/snv33637.jpg"><img alt="SNV33637" src="./images/2008/12/snv33637-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33637" /></a>

<p>I recorded Georo going down on the last run. He tried to hit a crap load
of jumps but fell on nearly all of them. Turn the volume down, all
you’re gonna hear is wind.</p>

                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<h2>Day Three: Cloudy skies, slush.</h2>
<p>The weather suddenly got a lot warmer on the third day, around the 40’s
and 50’s. It caused a lot of the snow to melt and it formed puddles of
slush and water everywhere making everyone get wet.</p>
<p><a href="./images/2008/12/snv33645.jpg"><img alt="SNV33645" src="./images/2008/12/snv33645-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33645" /></a>

<p>Some funny stuff happened today too. According to Hannan, Quentin got
anal raped. Hahahaha.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dllPLMOqeS0'

                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>I recorded Georo again but in the middle of it I fall cause I was trying
to ride switch. Yeah, that wasn’t fun.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"

                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>Then Georo recorded me, I fell again cause there was an unexpected pile
snow there. Georo doesn’t know how to hold a camera.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/o0-sTulHRgg'

                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>And here’s a video of Hannan heelsliding his way down the mountain.
Haha.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnfhgkYqIaM'

                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<h2>Day Four: Clear Skies, Ice Ice Ice.</h2>
<p>The fourth day was so bad. The temperature got colder and the water and
slush from the previous day froze and turned into ice. To add onto that,
the edges on my board were super dull. I was slipping and sliding
everywhere. Ice SUCKS. At least the temperature was cold enough for them
to make snow but it still wasn’t enough to cover the ICEEEEEE.</p>
<p><a href="./images/2008/12/pano1.jpg"><img alt="pano" src="./images/2008/12/pano-thumb1.jpg" title="pano" /></a></p>
<p>Quentin got hurt again. This time he hurt his neck and had to be brought
down by one of those sled things. I didn’t get to see it, wished I got
it on video.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a pretty fun trip. The conditions weren’t as nice as I
wanted them to be but its okay cause I finally learned to ride switch.
Hopefully, we’ll get to go to somewhere more awesome next time like
Vermont or maybe even Colorado or Utah.</p>
<p>I need new boots.</p>

		<p>It’s snowing! Although it isn’t the first time this season its still
pretty awesome. Weather.com says its gonna be about 4-6 inches of snow
around campus.</p>
<p>I hope there’s like 100 times more snow up on the mountains. I want to
ride some snow up there not some stupid ice we’re known for on the ICE
COAST. I’m extra excited to go this season. I don’t really know why. I
guess cause college has been a crap load of work and snowboarding is
such a great way to just chill.</p>

		<p>I think <a href="http://tokyoflash.com">Tokyoflash</a> has the coolest watches
ever. They're kinda high-tech and futuristic-looking and imported from
JAPAN! We all know Japan makes the coolest shit.</p>
<p><a href="./images/2008/12/oberon.jpg"><img alt="oberon" src="./images/2008/12/oberon-thumb.jpg" /></a>
The watch on the right is called the S-Mode Oberon. It's the one I got
after I broke my G-shock watch. The outer ring is hours, inner most ring
is tens digit of the minutes, and the one in the middle is the ones
digit. When I first got it, it took forever to figure out what time it
was but then I got used to it. Its cool because other people can't tell
what time it is. It's probably the coolest watch I ever had minus this
Power Rangers watch I had when I was little.</p>
<p>Check it out in action (skip to 2:30):</p>

<p>But I broke the strap it some freak freebording accident and I still
haven't gotten it fixed. I'll probably get it fixed over the winter
break(SNOWBOARD 08!!!!!!) or maybe I'll just give it to my brother as a
present. I want to get another one but they're so freaking expensive.</p>
<p>I hate not having a watch and not knowing what time it is.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I hate reading. I don't find it interesting at all. And I don't get how
people can just sit down and read a entire book. I think it's the most
boring crap ever. I would rather sit around and do nothing than read a
book. That's how much it sucks.</p>
<p>I do this weird thing when I read. I'll be reading and then I'll start
thinking about something random word I read in the book. Then I'll stop
daydreaming and I'll be a page ahead from where I started daydreaming.
It's like I can daydream and read at the same time but I won't remember
anything that I read.</p>
<p>If they were subtitles to a movie I was watching, then I have no problem
reading that. But whenever I see pages and pages of huge blocks of text
and no pictures, I freaking hate it. I think its kind of like waiting in
a huge ass line for absolutely... NOTHING!</p>
<p>So yeah, sorry for making you read.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Qwop is this dude that comes from a country whose training program was
under-funded and now has to run in the Olympics. What you do in the game
is try to run 100 meters using the Q, W, O and P keys without falling
over. Q and W control the thighs and O and P control the calves.</p>

<p>I found this on <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2008/11/browser_game_pick_qwop_olympic.html">Indie
Games</a>.
It's probably one of the stupidest games I've ever played but I have no
idea why its so addicting. When you first play the game, it seems
impossible to run but then you get the hang of it and it's kind of
satisfying. Its hilarious when Qwop falls cause he looks so freaking
dumb. My best is 53.2m by actually running. Not that stupid crawling
crap.</p>

	<div class="article_text">
		<p>A couple days ago, I went to the
<a href="http://www.campusdining.org/location-union-commons?PHPSESSID=3793723da705a07bf83ca0fad2a01fd3">Union</a>
to get some food with people. I went in and grabbed CJ's Chicken Tenders
and a cream soda and sat down to eat. I start eating the chicken tenders
one by one not really paying attention to what they looked like.
Finally, I got to the last one and noticed something strange about it.</p>

<p>I thought It would be funny to put
<a href="http://qtjoel.com/2008/10/14/jason-tutoring/">Jason</a> on it. Just look
at his face! What a douche.</p>
<p><a href="./images/2008/11/chicken-tender-5.jpg"><img alt="Chicken Tender

<p>I still haven't eaten the penis-shaped chicken tender 'cause it seems
kind of awkward. It stuck it in the fridge and now its just sitting
there. Maybe someday someone will open it and eat it, not paying
attention to the shape of it, and we'll all laugh at him. Penis-eater.</p>

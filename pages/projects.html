<h2>Depth Beneath</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&amp;uid=34130"><img alt="" src="../images/2014/04/title-570x389.png" title="depthbeneath" /></a></p>
<p>April 2014</p>
<p>C#, Unity3D</p>
<p>This was a game I made for a 72 hour game jam with my friend Hannan.
It was my first time doing a game jam like this and it was pretty 
fun. We placed 57th out of 1,004 entries and got 24th in the Fun category.</p>

<h2>Voxel Terrain</h2>
<p><a href="../images/2012/05/voxelterrain.png"><img alt="" src="../images/2012/05/voxelterrain-570x349.png" title="voxelterrain" /></a></p>
<p>Spring 2012</p>
<p>C++, OpenGL</p>
<p>This was my final project for my computer graphics course. It is
procedurally generated voxel terrain, which is just a fancy phrase for
Minecraft terrain. Terrain is generated using Perlin noise and is stored
in chunks. And all of it is generated in real-time.</p>
<p>Functionality-wise, the user can only fly through the world and look at
the terrain features. The blocks can't really be modified by the user.
Hopefully, I'll have time to add this in later.</p>
<p>This was my first real experience with OpenGL and 3D graphics
programming.</p>
<p>I made a couple of blog posts about this project <a href="../tag/cse328.html">here</a>. In the link, you'll find
videos and some details about changes I made through each revision. You
can download the exe <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/417221/voxelterrain.zip">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Swarm</h2>
<p><a href="../images/2012/05/swarm.png"><img alt="" src="../images/2012/05/swarm-570x340.png" title="swarm" /></a></p>
<p>2011</p>
<p>Java,Slick2D</p>
<p>This was a zombie game that I was working on for a bit. The objective of
the game is to build up your zombie army by eating up people in the
city. As your zombie mob got bigger, the people in the city would start
calling for backup. Militia, cops, then army.</p>
<p>Most of the boilerplate stuff from the game is done with Slick2D.
However, I did add my own A* and steering behavior implementations.</p>
<p>Because it's not really in a playable state, I don't have a runnable jar
available. Sorry.</p>

<h2>Typist</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="http://chenstopher.com/teamlevel/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/typist_screenshot.png" title="Typist" /></p>
<p>2010</p>
<p>C++, DirectX, Lua</p>
<p>This is a strategy/typing game I made from the group part of the game
programming course. As words fly across the screen, the player has to
type them to gain energy. The player then uses this energy to spawn
units and defeat his enemies.</p>
<p>For this project, I used Lua to script levels, scenes, and menus.</p>
<p>I wanted to make a typing game because I was learning Dvorak at the time
and I thought making a game out of it would be a good way to learn it.</p>
<p>It was also a finalist in the Stony Brook Game Programming Competition
but unfortunately didn't win.</p>

<h2>I woke up late and now I have to rocket jump pass zombies to get to class!</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="http://chenstopher.com/cse380/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/zombie_final.png" title="Zombie" />  </p>
<p>2010</p>
<p>C++, DirectX, Lua</p>
<p>Here's a game I made as the individual project for my game programming
course. The basic concept is the world got infected by zombies as I was
sleeping and for some unknown reason, I decide to go to class. But a
long the way I guess I find a rocket launcher and so I decide to rocket
jump to class.</p>
<p>For this project, I learned how to use Lua and used it to do some basic
data loading.</p>

<h2>Riot Roundup</h2>
<p><a href="../images/2012/05/riotroundup.png"><img alt="" src="../images/2012/05/riotroundup-570x323.png" title="riotroundup" /></a></p>
<p>2007</p>
<p>Java</p>
<p>This was one of the first games I made. It is basically a clone of a
minigame in a game on the PSP called Work Time Fun. The point of the
game is to run around the city and collect as many people to join you in
your riot in the park.</p>

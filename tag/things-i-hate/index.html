		<p>I hate reading. I don't find it interesting at all. And I don't get how
people can just sit down and read a entire book. I think it's the most
boring crap ever. I would rather sit around and do nothing than read a
book. That's how much it sucks.</p>
<p>I do this weird thing when I read. I'll be reading and then I'll start
thinking about something random word I read in the book. Then I'll stop
daydreaming and I'll be a page ahead from where I started daydreaming.
It's like I can daydream and read at the same time but I won't remember
anything that I read.</p>
<p>If they were subtitles to a movie I was watching, then I have no problem
reading that. But whenever I see pages and pages of huge blocks of text
and no pictures, I freaking hate it. I think its kind of like waiting in
a huge ass line for absolutely... NOTHING!</p>
<p>So yeah, sorry for making you read.</p>

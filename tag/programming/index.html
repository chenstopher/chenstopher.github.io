		<p>So I was sitting around yesterday bored out of my mind. Seriously. I
started staring at the fish on my desktop.</p>
<p><img alt="desktop-the-fish" src="../../images/2009/03/desktopthefish2.jpg" title="desktop-the-fish" /></p>
<p>I was trying to look for something to do. Searched DC++ for some games
to play, didn’t really work. Tried to watch a movie, wasn’t in the mood.
Do homework? It was a Saturday. No one does homework on Saturday.</p>
<p>Then I thought, I kinda want to learn Blender and 3D modeling and
texturing. You know, do some animation and game programming. If I wanted
to do animation, I’d have to learn some video editing. And for game
programming, I’d have to learn DirectX programming and more C++. So, I
ended up making a list of stuff I wanted to learn.</p>
<h2>The List</h2>
<ul>
<li>DirectX</li>
<li>Advanced Game Programming</li>
<li>More C++</li>
<li>Blender/3D Modeling/Textures</li>
<li>Basic Animation</li>
<li>Basic Video Editing</li>
<li>iPhone App Development</li>
<li>Android Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah that’s a lot of stuff but it’ll give me something to do if I ever
fall into “help I’m bored out of my mind” state again. If it ever does
happen I can just refer to the list and google up some tutorials.</p>
<p>I tried to start learning Blender but Windows 7 had some problems with
it and I didn’t feel like booting up the Vista partition. So I just
spent the rest of the day doing nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah I know. I’m lazy. I should probably actually try to accomplish
stuff on the list instead of just making one for fun but you know what?
Screw you. Just keeeeding. Haha.</p>
<p>I think I’ll start with DirectX/Game/C++.</p>

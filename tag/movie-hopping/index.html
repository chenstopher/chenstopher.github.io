		<p>Went movie hopping today and saw four movies.</p>
<p>The first movie was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/">Chronicle</a>.
This one was unexpectedly good. I was going into this thinking that it
would be another crappy teens with super power movie (see Jumper) but
man was I surprised.</p>
<p>Then I went over to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596365/">The Woman in
Black</a>. It was a solid ghost story
but had your typical horror movie scare tactics. I liked it though. The
only thing that slightly bothered me was Daniel Radcliffe's role as a
father. I couldn't help thinking, "THIS GUY IS HARRY POTTER DAMN IT."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1601913/">The Grey</a> was the third one and
definitely my favorite out of the ones I watched today. Just a great
story about survival and the toll it takes on human beings. It reminded
me a lot of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106246/">Alive</a>, a similar
movie that I liked. It was even referenced by one of the characters in
The Grey.</p>
<p>Watched<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229238/">Mission Impossible: Ghost
Protocol</a> last. I missed the first
couple minutes cause I Â was waiting for the after credits scene for The
Grey. I don't usually like action movies like these, but it was
entertaining. Good action scenes, awesome gadgets, and a bit of humor
here and there.</p>
<p>I think I could've did one more but there was nothing good to watch and
I was tired of eating gummy bears and Milk Duds.</p>
<p>Note to future Chris: Do this again.</p>

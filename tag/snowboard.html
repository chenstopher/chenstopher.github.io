	<div class="article_text">
		<p>I think I suffered a concussion yesterday but I don’t remember. I’m
going to try and make a timeline of events to try to remember what I did
yesterday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I drove to Hunter Mountain. I vaguely remember how I got there.</p>
<p>I stopped at McDonalds. Not sure what I ordered. I remember going to the
restroom in there though.</p>
<p>Got to the mountain and parked the car somewhere near the six-person
lift. I then suited up and put on my new kneepads. Had to take a crap so
I went to the bathroom near the ticket counter, leaving my board on one
of the racks.</p>
<p>Went back to snowboarding and saw that the line for the six-person lift
was getting long so I went to the other lift. Thought to myself, “Shit
this lift is so slow.”</p>
<p>I remember going up the lift a couple times, but I only remember
snowboarding down once. And that was when I broke my binding strap.</p>
<p>Broke my binding strap by stepping on it while I was at the top of the
mountain. Rode down the mountain with a broken strap and thought to
myself, “It feels the same”. Brought it into the shop to get it fixed. I
said, “Do you guys have replacement straps for Flow bindings?”. She
said, “No but you can wait till my coworker gets back and we’ll see what
we can do. You can wait in here or come back later.” I said, “I’ll come
back later.” I went back later and the guy replaced the broken strap
with another strap. There was no hole for the screw on the replacement
strap so I said, “I don’t think it’ll fit”. He said, “I’ll make it fit”
and continued to drill a whole in the strap.</p>
<p>I don’t remember anything that happened after this.</p>
<p>I don’t remember the snow conditions.</p>
<p>I don’t remember doing any runs.</p>
<p>I don’t remember the lifts closing.</p>
<p>I don’t remember looking for my car.</p>
<p>I don’t remember taking off my snow gear.</p>
<p>I don’t remember driving off the mountain.</p>
<p>I remember that I was low on gas but I don’t remember getting gas. I
found a receipt in my wallet for \$75 worth of gas.</p>
<p>I remember drinking Iced Tea Lemonade but I don’t remember buying it.</p>
<p>I sort of remember driving home but I don’t remember what roads I took.</p>
<p>I think I ran a red light but I don’t remember.</p>
<p>I remember driving the car into the driveway, but not opening the gate.</p>
<p>I brought all my equipment in the house, to the basement.</p>
<p>Then, I went to bother my brother in his room.</p>
<p>I don’t remember taking off my contacts.</p>
<p>When my parents came home, I went to tell them that I don’t remember
anything. My mom said I called her multiple times (my phone’s call log
says 13). She said I called her once to tell her that I couldn’t find
the car. I don’t remember that. Another time I asked her what kind of
gas I should fill up the car with. I don’t remember that. She also said
she called me at around 4:20 to ask me where I was and I responded by
saying, “I don’t know who you are. Who are you? My head hurts.”</p>
<p>I ate some food, took some pills, and went to sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that is all I remember and don’t remember from yesterday. I woke up
today with the top of my head hurting and neck sore. I’m guessing I fell
while snowboarding, got a concussion, and am suffering from memory loss
but I don’t remember. It’s weird because the things I do remember feel
like they are parts of a dream. But I am sure it wasn’t just a dream
because I have the receipts from the gas and the drink I bought, and the
strap that the guy at the shop replaced.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the weirdest experience of my life.</p>

		<p>We finally got to go snowboarding even though the trip was nearly
cancelled. It was a four day trip to
<a href="http://www.belleayre.com">Belleayre</a>, a small but fun mountain. The
conditions ranged from wet slushy snow to man-made snow over ice and
super fog to bright sunshine. The ice sucked but it was pretty good
overall. I finally learned to ride switch which is awesome. And this is
how it went down.</p>

<h2>Day One: Clear skies, loose granular.</h2>
<p>We left early Friday morning after staying up the previous night playing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunbound_">Gunbound</a>(we were bored, really
really bored). A lot of people went: my mom, dad, Georo, Hannan,
Quentin, Brian, Clifford, Kevin, Alpha and me. David was supposed to
come but he was a little girl and stayed home. It was gonna be a long
drive so we brought <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386064/">Tae Guk Gi</a>
with us. Ended up not watching it.There was a really nice sunrise on the
way there. Got a couple of pictures of it. It was a pretty boring ride
so the guys fell asleep.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/12/snv33615.jpg"><img alt="SNV33615" src="../images/2008/12/snv33615-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33615" /></a>

<p>We finally got to the mountain. The snow was okay, at least it wasn’t
ice. Hannan has never gone snowboarding so on his first time off the
chairlift, he did a face plant. It was pretty funny. I made a few runs
and then we got stuck on the lift! We must’ve been there for at least 30
minutes.</p>

                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>Me and Georo did a couple runs at the upper mountain and that was the
end of day one. I was pretty tired ‘cause it’s been a while since I last
went snowboarding.</p>
<h2>Day Two: Rain and Fog, Wet Snow.</h2>
<p>The day started out kinda crappy. We woke up to rain so we decided to
wait till it stopped to go up to the mountain. The snow got all wet but
it wasn’t that bad. But the sky was FREAKING FOGGY.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/12/snv33637.jpg"><img alt="SNV33637" src="../images/2008/12/snv33637-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33637" /></a>

<p>I recorded Georo going down on the last run. He tried to hit a crap load
of jumps but fell on nearly all of them. Turn the volume down, all
you’re gonna hear is wind.</p>

            </div></p>
<h2>Day Three: Cloudy skies, slush.</h2>
<p>The weather suddenly got a lot warmer on the third day, around the 40’s
and 50’s. It caused a lot of the snow to melt and it formed puddles of
slush and water everywhere making everyone get wet.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/12/snv33645.jpg"><img alt="SNV33645" src="../images/2008/12/snv33645-thumb.jpg" title="SNV33645" /></a>

<p>Some funny stuff happened today too. According to Hannan, Quentin got
anal raped. Hahahaha.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dllPLMOqeS0'
                    frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen
                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>I recorded Georo again but in the middle of it I fall cause I was trying
to ride switch. Yeah, that wasn’t fun.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IoG2-iRIFD8'
                    frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen
                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>Then Georo recorded me, I fell again cause there was an unexpected pile
snow there. Georo doesn’t know how to hold a camera.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/o0-sTulHRgg'
                    frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen
                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>And here’s a video of Hannan heelsliding his way down the mountain.
Haha.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnfhgkYqIaM'
                    frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen
                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<h2>Day Four: Clear Skies, Ice Ice Ice.</h2>
<p>The fourth day was so bad. The temperature got colder and the water and
slush from the previous day froze and turned into ice. To add onto that,
the edges on my board were super dull. I was slipping and sliding
everywhere. Ice SUCKS. At least the temperature was cold enough for them
to make snow but it still wasn’t enough to cover the ICEEEEEE.</p>
<p><a href="../images/2008/12/pano1.jpg"><img alt="pano" src="../images/2008/12/pano-thumb1.jpg" title="pano" /></a></p>
<p>Quentin got hurt again. This time he hurt his neck and had to be brought
down by one of those sled things. I didn’t get to see it, wished I got
it on video.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a pretty fun trip. The conditions weren’t as nice as I
wanted them to be but its okay cause I finally learned to ride switch.
Hopefully, we’ll get to go to somewhere more awesome next time like
Vermont or maybe even Colorado or Utah.</p>
<p>I need new boots.</p>

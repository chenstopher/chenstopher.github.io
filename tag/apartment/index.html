		<p>I've been thinking about implementing some home automation in my apartment for a while
now. I've always wanted to be able to control my lights, blinds, ac, fan, etc using 
just my phone. So I finally got off my butt and started working on it.</p>
<p>After doing some research, I ordered 
a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X0AWA6E">Z-Stick</a>,
a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007UZH7B8">Z-Wave switch</a>,
and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008VWBNAU">Z-Wave in-wall relay</a>.
I also had a spare Raspberry PI collecting dust so I decided to use that 
as the server. I'll probably pick up some more devices later on to connect the 
rest of my apartment if things go well.</p>
<p>Originally I was gonna write some server software to handle the all this stuff but then 
I found out about <a href="http://www.openhab.org/">openHAB</a>. It's this open source automation 
software that seems pretty popular. I figured there's no point reinventing the wheel so
I went with that and installed it on my rPI.</p>
<p>And so after a couple hours of wtfs I finally got one of the lights working! Check out the 
video.</p>
<p><div class="videobox">
                <iframe width="640" height="390"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYxTaaYSiIc'
                    frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen
                    allowFullScreen>
                </iframe>
            </div></p>
<p>It was actually super exciting the first time it flipped on. It's been a while since I got
to work on something fun like this. I can't wait till I get all the other stuff installed.</p>

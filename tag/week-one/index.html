		<p>26 October 2010</p>
	</header>
	<div class="article_text">
		<p>Surprisingly, the first day on the everyman schedule wasn’t so bad. I
followed the schedule pretty tightly. I always slept and woke when I
should’ve and everything went to plan. I did, however, expect to be way
more tired than I actually was. I never found myself falling asleep
during the day or having the urge to lie on my bed and just sleep for
the rest of the day. Overall, I’d say the first day went well.</p>
<p>The second day, however, was pretty horrible. I didn’t really have
anything to do till 13:00 after waking up at a 7:00 so was completely
bored out of my mind and drifting into zombie mode. I was so tired and
all I wanted to do was sleep. But I didn’t want to give up so I just
played a couple levels of Trine.</p>
<p>I overslept on a 20 minute nap on day three and another 20 minute nap on
day four because my alarm didn’t ring. However, I was still able to
follow the schedule as normal and didn’t have trouble sleeping though
I’m becoming paranoid of my alarm trying to sabotage my sleep schedule.</p>
<p>I overslept again on day five. This time it was the 3 hour core nap. I
think the alarm went off on time and I shut it off and went back to
sleep but I can’t say that I remember. I ended up waking up right before
when my first nap should start so I just slept for another 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Day six was a disaster. It was a Sunday and I decided to go catch the
matinee showing of the Social Network (good movie, by the way). It was
at 11:20 and ended around 14:00 so I missed my 12:XX nap. Walked around
with a couple of friends till 18:00 where I took a nap on the train.
Then I took my 23:XX nap and over slept one hour. Missing my first nap
was terrible.</p>
<p>And the last day went pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a pretty interesting week. The entire week I felt like a
zombie. You know when you pull an all nighter and you get to that time
of day where you are know you haven’t slept but don’t really feel tired
and everything feels like a dream? That’s what it felt like for me
except for the entire day.</p>
<p>For some reason, waking up from the 3 hour nap felt worse than the 20
minute ones. After waking from a 20 minute nap, I feel really refreshed
and any sleepiness I had before going into it is mostly gone. The
post-3-hour-nap, however, is Getting past the time after waking up from
the 3 hour nap is the hardest part. That 7:00 to 9:50/12:50 period is
just complete zombie mode. Like a zombie that just got shot with a
tranquilizer gun. A little caffeine helps me get through it, but it’s
still difficult.</p>
<p>I still more tired than using a monophasic sleep schedule but I’m hoping
to get used to the Everyman by the second week.</p>

		<p>Some guy I used to be good friends with instant-messaged me today. It
was totally unexpected and weird and cool. Sent me down this spiral of
looking up people from my past (which was difficult cause I don't
use/have facebook). It was strange seeing people I haven't even thought
about in years again. It was depressing.</p>
<p>I had this theory when I was kid that when you flew on an airplane to
some destination on the other side of the planet, that the airplane
wasn't actually moving, but the world outside was being reconstructed
into the destination. Further places took longer because the landscapes,
cultures, people were more different than places closer to where you
were currently. What a stupid fucking self-centered idea.</p>
<p>Note to past Chris: you are/were stupid. Note to future Chris: do
something.</p>

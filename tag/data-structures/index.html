		<p>So I had an interview for an job yesterday. In fact, it was my first job
interview. It went okay.</p>
<p>One of the technical questions the interviewer asked was to create a
data structure that would insert in O(log n) and return an iterator that
would iterate the data back in sorted order in O(n) time. I knew it was
a binary tree and the iterator would use an inorder traversal of the
tree so I started typing it out.</p>
<p>But when I got to the iterator part, I just couldn't figure it out. Â I
knew for sure it was an inorder traversal but I couldn't figure out how
to turn the recursive algorithm that I knew into an iterative one. So I
sat there and drew some trees to try and visualize the algorithm for it.
I thought using a stack for the traversal would also probably work but I
couldn't figure that out either. And then time was up.</p>
<p>So we continued the interview. I asked some questions about the
position. Then the interview ended.</p>
<p>I hung around for a little bit with a friend that worked there and
referred me for the job then we biked back to our dorms. As soon as I
got back I opened up Visual Studio and worked on the problem again
because I knew that if I didn't I'd probably end up staying up all night
thinking about it.</p>
<p>It figured it out in ten minutes.</p>
<p>Coding under pressure, man. Can't do it.</p>

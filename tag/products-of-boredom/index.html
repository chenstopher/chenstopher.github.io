		<p>Today I decided that, from now on, I am only allowed to play Team
Fortress 2 on days that contain the letter "t". So Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays are TF2 Days.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will encourage me to do something productive like...
finishing all the other games in my Steam library.</p>

		<p>There is game I like to play when walking to and from places. It doesn’t
have a name… or a point, but it’s something to do while I walk.</p>
<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>Pick out an object a few feet in front of your path. It can be a stick,
puddle, or crack. Whatever. Just pick one out.</p>
<p>Then guess whether you will step on it with your left foot or your right
foot.</p>
<p>If you guess correctly, you win and you get to say “FUCK YEAH” to
yourself, in your head.</p>
<p>If you guess incorrectly, you lose and you only get to say “FUCK”.</p>
<p>And that’s it.</p>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<p>Here are two related observations I’ve made while playing this game:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will come up with a guess you are pretty sure of within a
    second. It will probably be correct.</li>
<li>If it takes more than a second or you can’t make up your mind, you
    will step over the object.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s probably some scientific term for that second phenomenon but I
don’t feel like researching it.</p>
<p>So that’s it. This is the type of stuff I come up with when I’m bored.</p>

		<p>01 March 2009</p>

		<p>So I was sitting around yesterday bored out of my mind. Seriously. I
started staring at the fish on my desktop.</p>
<p><img alt="desktop-the-fish" src="../../images/2009/03/desktopthefish2.jpg" title="desktop-the-fish" /></p>
<p>I was trying to look for something to do. Searched DC++ for some games
to play, didn’t really work. Tried to watch a movie, wasn’t in the mood.
Do homework? It was a Saturday. No one does homework on Saturday.</p>
<p>Then I thought, I kinda want to learn Blender and 3D modeling and
texturing. You know, do some animation and game programming. If I wanted
to do animation, I’d have to learn some video editing. And for game
programming, I’d have to learn DirectX programming and more C++. So, I
ended up making a list of stuff I wanted to learn.</p>
<h2>The List</h2>
<ul>
<li>DirectX</li>
<li>Advanced Game Programming</li>
<li>More C++</li>
<li>Blender/3D Modeling/Textures</li>
<li>Basic Animation</li>
<li>Basic Video Editing</li>
<li>iPhone App Development</li>
<li>Android Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah that’s a lot of stuff but it’ll give me something to do if I ever
fall into “help I’m bored out of my mind” state again. If it ever does
happen I can just refer to the list and google up some tutorials.</p>
<p>I tried to start learning Blender but Windows 7 had some problems with
it and I didn’t feel like booting up the Vista partition. So I just
spent the rest of the day doing nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah I know. I’m lazy. I should probably actually try to accomplish
stuff on the list instead of just making one for fun but you know what?
Screw you. Just keeeeding. Haha.</p>
<p>I think I’ll start with DirectX/Game/C++.</p>

		<p>If anyone is interested, I put up a project page for the game
programming course I'm taking (CSE380). For my individual project, I'm
making a game called "I WOKE UP LATE AND NOW I HAVE TO ROCKET JUMP PASS
ZOMBIES TO GET TO CLASS" or IWULANIHTRJPZTGTC for short or ZOMBIES for
shorter. There hasn't been much progress but I'm working on it.</p>

		<p>Yeah. I think I’m just gonna do C# and XNA game programming. Seems a
whole lot easier and I won’t have to manage memory.</p>
<p>Sure, C#/XNA is slower but I don’t think it matters when the games I
want to make are gonna be 2D. When I move on to 3D I think I’ll try
C++/DirectX again. I can’t really find any decent online resources for
DirectX right now and I don’t feel like buying a book.</p>
<p>I’ll probably take the game programming course here at Stony in a later
semester. The teacher is cool and having someone guide you through it is
a whole lot easier. Wish they had it when I was at Tech. Screw you weird
name people, Ariel and Aljohn. Oh and Lukasz.</p>
<p>This kid Allen(?) is starting up a game programming club so I’m gonna be
joining that. He seems pretty awesome at programming, much more
knowledgeable than I who only knows Java and a bit of C++ (and
php/html/css/js). It’ll be fun. I hope.</p>
<p>So anyway, I’ve starting learning C# and it’s a lot like Java. That’s
kind of a good thing since Java’s pretty easy. Still deciding on game to
start off with.</p>
<p>Snake? Space Invaders? Tetris? PONG?!</p>
<p>For the sake of randomness. Here’s a video of one of the <a href="http://tigsource.com/articles/2007/06/11/nikujin">best games
ever</a>.</p>

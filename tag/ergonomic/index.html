		<p>I told myself I wasn’t going to buy anything but Steam games this Black
Friday but I couldn’t resist. <a href="http://www.thehumansolution.com/kinesis-advantage.html">The Human
Solution</a> was
having a sale on the <a href="http://kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm">Kinesis
Advantage</a> (a \$300 dollar
keyboard) with a 10% off coupon for Black Friday and free shipping. FREE
SHIPPING!</p>

<p>Yep, I just bought this keyboard for \$242.10, shipped.</p>
<p>Now let me explain. My RSI/carpal-tunnel symptoms have been getting
worse and worse so I’ve been looking for some ergonomic keyboards to
help fix it. There is quite a selection of them but I wanted one with
mechanical switches leaving only a few (expensive) choices. Among them
was the the Kinesis Advantage, one of the highest-regarded ergonomic
keyboards. The huge price tag had put me off initially but then I
thought about it for a bit. Here’s the rationale I came up with to
convince myself into buying it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m probably going to be making a living typing on a keyboard, might
    as well make it a nice one and not ruin my hands.</li>
<li>I’m hoping this will help with the RSI/carpal-tunnel problems.
    Better get a ergonomic keyboard than have to go to doctor to treat
    them, right?</li>
<li>It’ll make me type faster and be more productive (hopefully).</li>
<li>It’ll look super cool!</li>
<li>\$242.10 is still not that expensive for a keyboard is it? I feel
    like keyboards are often the most neglected piece of computer
    hardware and most people buy the cheapest one they can find. As a
    person who uses the computer for the majority of the day, the
    keyboard is one of the most important pieces of a system. It’s how
    you interact with your computer, how you control it (yeah, yeah,
    there’s the mouse too). It should be on par with the other
    components of your system.</li>
<li>IT’S 19.3% OFF!</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one was what really convinced me to buy it. Can’t mess with
the percentages man.</p>
<p>I will probably put up a review when I get it. I’m excited; I love
getting stuff in the mail.</p>

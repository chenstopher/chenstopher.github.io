		<p>I couldn’t sleep so I spent the whole night looking through reddit.com.</p>
<p>Some interesting stuff going on.</p>
<p>Okay maybe not.</p>
<p>School is starting up soon. That sucks.</p>
<p>I really don’t want to go back to school.</p>
<p>I think medicine, doctors, technology and all that stuff are limiting
the rate that humans are evolving. That is if evolution works.</p>
<p>Why is my iPhone so slow?</p>
<p>If I go to sleep, I don’t want to wake up. If I stay awake, I don’t want
to sleep.</p>
<p>Sunflower seeds are pretty good.</p>
<p>The street lights on my block turn off at about 6:52 am. This picture
was taken at 6:39.</p>

<p>That’s not the sun.</p>
<p>There was this dude on the train the other day. He was arguing with the
other dudes about how his girlfriend wasn’t let on some bus. I think he
was drunk. It was interesting.</p>
<p>I stay up really late sometimes. I like it cause everyone else is
sleeping.</p>
<p>Do not litter.</p>
<p>I usually sleep around 6. But its been taking me a lot longer to fall
asleep lately. I don’t know why.</p>
<p>These sunflower seeds taste funny.</p>
<p>Actually I do know why. But I’m not telling you.</p>
<p>I like it when I stay up really late and I get really tired. So tired
that my eyes wont stay open. I like going to sleep during that time.</p>
<p>Hey look, Chloe is sleeping.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/2009/01/chloesleeping.jpg"><img alt="chloe
sleeping" src="../../images/2009/01/chloesleeping-thumb.jpg" title="chloe sleeping" /></a></p>
<p>She’s gotten bigger.</p>
<p>I miss my watch.</p>
<p>Oh and about the Windows 7 on my laptop post that I said I was gonna do.
I’m not gonna do it cause I don’t care and you don’t care. Maybe you do
care but I don’t care that you care. So stop caring.</p>
<p>jQuery’s slideDown function is pissing me off. WORK.</p>
<p>“Then why do we die?” –awesome kid</p>
<p>I think I’ll go to sleep now. Maybe.</p>
<p>time--;</p>

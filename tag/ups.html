<p>I ordered a pair of shoes last week that was slated to arrive Monday.
They never showed up. So I checked the UPS tracking info to see what the
heck happened. It just said, "The package was missed at the UPS
facility, UPS will deliver on the next business day". Thinking that
they'd just deliver the thing tomorrow (like it said in the message), I
just put it off as some UPS nonsense and decided to wait for it to
arrive on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tuesday comes, doesn't show up. Wednesday, doesn't show up. Each day the
UPS tracking info page updates at 10:00 pm saying the same exact
message: "The package was missed at the UPS facility, UPS will deliver
on the next business day."Â Surely, something must have gone wrong. I
give Zappos a call and they say to just wait it out and if it doesn't
arrive, just give them another call.</p>
<p>So I wait another day and guess what.. the shoes still haven't arrived.
I call up Zappos again, explain my situation, and the guy says they'll
just send another pair free of charge (btw, great customer support). The
very second I get off the phone, some guy comes to the door and rings
the bell. It's the UPS guy. With my shoes. That I ordered last week.</p>
<p>I end up calling Zappos for the third time to explain my matter of great
coincidental timing and tell them to cancel that order they made just
two minutes prior.</p>
<p>So that's my exciting ordering shoes online story.</p>

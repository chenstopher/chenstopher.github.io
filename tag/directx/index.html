		<p>Yeah. I think I’m just gonna do C# and XNA game programming. Seems a
whole lot easier and I won’t have to manage memory.</p>
<p>Sure, C#/XNA is slower but I don’t think it matters when the games I
want to make are gonna be 2D. When I move on to 3D I think I’ll try
C++/DirectX again. I can’t really find any decent online resources for
DirectX right now and I don’t feel like buying a book.</p>
<p>I’ll probably take the game programming course here at Stony in a later
semester. The teacher is cool and having someone guide you through it is
a whole lot easier. Wish they had it when I was at Tech. Screw you weird
name people, Ariel and Aljohn. Oh and Lukasz.</p>
<p>This kid Allen(?) is starting up a game programming club so I’m gonna be
joining that. He seems pretty awesome at programming, much more
knowledgeable than I who only knows Java and a bit of C++ (and
php/html/css/js). It’ll be fun. I hope.</p>
<p>So anyway, I’ve starting learning C# and it’s a lot like Java. That’s
kind of a good thing since Java’s pretty easy. Still deciding on game to
start off with.</p>
<p>Snake? Space Invaders? Tetris? PONG?!</p>
<p>For the sake of randomness. Here’s a video of one of the <a href="http://tigsource.com/articles/2007/06/11/nikujin">best games
ever</a>.</p>

		<p>So I was sitting around yesterday bored out of my mind. Seriously. I
started staring at the fish on my desktop.</p>
<p><img alt="desktop-the-fish" src="../../images/2009/03/desktopthefish2.jpg" title="desktop-the-fish" /></p>
<p>I was trying to look for something to do. Searched DC++ for some games
to play, didn’t really work. Tried to watch a movie, wasn’t in the mood.
Do homework? It was a Saturday. No one does homework on Saturday.</p>
<p>Then I thought, I kinda want to learn Blender and 3D modeling and
texturing. You know, do some animation and game programming. If I wanted
to do animation, I’d have to learn some video editing. And for game
programming, I’d have to learn DirectX programming and more C++. So, I
ended up making a list of stuff I wanted to learn.</p>
<h2>The List</h2>
<ul>
<li>DirectX</li>
<li>Advanced Game Programming</li>
<li>More C++</li>
<li>Blender/3D Modeling/Textures</li>
<li>Basic Animation</li>
<li>Basic Video Editing</li>
<li>iPhone App Development</li>
<li>Android Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah that’s a lot of stuff but it’ll give me something to do if I ever
fall into “help I’m bored out of my mind” state again. If it ever does
happen I can just refer to the list and google up some tutorials.</p>
<p>I tried to start learning Blender but Windows 7 had some problems with
it and I didn’t feel like booting up the Vista partition. So I just
spent the rest of the day doing nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah I know. I’m lazy. I should probably actually try to accomplish
stuff on the list instead of just making one for fun but you know what?
Screw you. Just keeeeding. Haha.</p>
<p>I think I’ll start with DirectX/Game/C++.</p>
